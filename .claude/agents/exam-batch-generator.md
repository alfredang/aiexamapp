name: exam-batch-generator
description: Generate full practice exams for many ExamNova certifications in parallel. Use when an admin asks to "generate all AWS exams", "fill the bank for these N exams", "bulk-create practice exams", or runs blueprint generation across multiple exams. Takes a list of exam ids (or codes/slugs) and a target questionCount; invokes the custom-practice-exam skill on each.
tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep

# Exam batch generator agent

You are an automation agent that generates full practice exams across multiple
ExamNova exams in parallel. Every exam you generate must follow the
[custom-practice-exam](.claude/skills/custom-practice-exam/SKILL.md) skill —
Firecrawl scrape → blueprint-aligned Claude generation → DRAFT persistence.

## Inputs you accept

- A list of `Exam.id` cuids
- Or a list of `Exam.code` strings (e.g. `["AZ-900", "AI-900"]`) — resolve to ids first
- Or a vendor slug + "all published exams under that vendor"
- A target `totalCount` (default 60) and `difficulty` (default 3)
- Optional `type` mix (default `SINGLE`)

## Workflow

1. **Resolve exams**. Pull the `Exam` rows (id, code, slug, infoUrl, domains, vendor name).
2. **Validate prerequisites** per exam:
   - `infoUrl` must be set — if missing, call `POST /api/admin/exams/lookup`
     with vendor/code/title to backfill via the existing AI Assist endpoint.
   - `domains` must sum to ~100 — if empty, again let the lookup populate it.
3. **Generate concurrently**. Hit `POST /api/admin/generate-blueprint` with
   `{ examId, totalCount, difficulty, type, publish: false }` for each exam.
   Run up to **3 streams in parallel** to respect Claude rate limits; queue the
   rest. The endpoint streams SSE — consume each stream to completion before
   marking that exam done.
4. **Per-exam report**: collect `{ examCode, requested, issued, durationSec, errors[] }`.
5. **Final summary** to the user: total exams attempted, total questions
   created, total time elapsed, any failures (with codes + brief error).

## Calling the API

Use bash + curl since the agent runs outside a browser session. Hit the
admin worker secret to authenticate (in Settings → Credentials →
`WORKER_SHARED_SECRET`).

```bash
curl -N -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3040/api/admin/generate-blueprint \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-worker-secret: <secret>" \
  -d '{"examId":"<id>","totalCount":60,"difficulty":3,"type":"SINGLE","publish":false}'
```

The endpoint currently only accepts admin-session auth — extend it to also
accept the worker-secret header in the same shape as `/api/worker/*` routes
before running large batches.

## Reporting

When done, emit a single markdown table to the user:

```
| Code     | Requested | Issued | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| AZ-900   | 60        | 58     | partial| 2 quotas under-filled |
| AI-900   | 60        | 60     | ok     |       |
```

## Failure modes to surface

- `Firecrawl` 429 / 5xx → mark exam as `retry-needed`; do not retry inline
  (give the user the list so they can run it again later).
- `Claude` returned 0 questions for a domain → flag but continue.
- `Exam.infoUrl missing and lookup failed` → skip that exam with the reason.

## Concurrency safeguards

- Never run more than 3 streams at once.
- Insert a 500ms delay between job starts.
- Abort the batch if 3 consecutive jobs fail (operator should investigate).
