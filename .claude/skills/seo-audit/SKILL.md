# SEO audit skill for ExamNova

When invoked, run the following audit sequence and produce an actionable report.

## 1. Inventory the public surface

Enumerate every public route reachable without auth:
- `/` (homepage)
- `/practice-exams` (catalog)
- `/practice-exams/[vendor]` (vendor page)
- `/practice-exams/[vendor]/[slug]` (exam detail)
- `/practice-exams/[vendor]/[slug]/teaser` (free 10-question teaser)
- `/p/[slug]` (Pages — Terms, Privacy, About, etc.)
- `/pricing`, `/faq` (if rendered)

For each route, fetch the rendered HTML at `http://127.0.0.1:3040<path>` and extract:
- `<title>` (length + presence)
- `<meta name="description">` (length 120–180 chars ideal)
- `<meta name="keywords">` (optional but populated by ExamNova)
- `<meta property="og:title">`, `og:description`, `og:image`
- Presence of structured data (`<script type="application/ld+json">`)
- Number of `<h1>` (should be exactly 1)
- Word count of main content
- Canonical link

## 2. Validate sitemap + robots

- `GET /sitemap.xml` → must return XML with `<urlset>` and contain the homepage + at least one vendor + one exam
- `GET /robots.txt` (if missing, propose creating one that references `/sitemap.xml`)

## 3. DB-side meta coverage

Use the Prisma client (`tsx scripts/<name>.ts`) to compute:
- Number of `Exam` rows with `published=true && deletedAt=null && metaTitle IS NULL` — those need SEO populated via the AI Assist button on the exam edit page or the batch script `scripts/seo-populate.ts` (create if missing).
- Number of `Page` rows with `published=true && metaTitle IS NULL`.

## 4. Per-exam structured data

Each exam detail page should expose `Course` JSON-LD with at minimum:
- `@type: Course`, `name`, `description`, `provider.name`
- `aggregateRating` when ≥10 attempts have been submitted with scores
- `offers` reflecting the Practice + Voucher tiers and prices

Verify the exam detail rendering includes a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block. If missing, propose adding it next to the existing tier price card.

## 5. Output format

Produce a single markdown report titled "SEO audit — YYYY-MM-DD" with sections:
- **Summary** — counts of passing / failing pages, biggest 3 issues
- **Per-page issues** — table: path · title-len · description-len · h1-count · OG present · JSON-LD present · notes
- **DB coverage gaps** — exact SQL or Prisma snippets the operator can run
- **Top 5 recommended fixes** — concrete, ordered by impact

Do NOT modify code yourself unless the user has explicitly approved a fix. Always present the report first.

## 6. Useful one-liners

```bash
# Render a page and grep meta tags
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3040/ | grep -oE '<title>[^<]*</title>|<meta [^>]*(name|property)="(description|keywords|og:[^"]*)"[^>]*>'

# Count exams missing SEO meta
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U aiexams -d aiexams -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"Exam\" WHERE published=true AND \"deletedAt\" IS NULL AND \"metaTitle\" IS NULL;"
```
