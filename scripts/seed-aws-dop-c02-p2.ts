    explanation: 'The existing Jenkins implementation runs on an Amazon EC2 instance, and this requires more operational management compared to using AWS CodeBuild which is a managed service. The DevOps engineer should replace Jenkins with AWS CodeBuild which is a fully managed build service. CodeBuild compiles source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. Encryption for build artifacts such as a cache, logs, exported raw test report data files, and build results, is enabled by default, and uses AWS managed keys (AWS KMS). CORRECT: "Replace the Jenkins instance running on Amazon EC2 with AWS CodeBuild and configure artifact encryption" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Configure AWS Systems Manager to patch the Jenkins EC2 instances and set encryption for all Amazon EBS volumes" is incorrect. This solution may be secure, but it does require more operational management compared to using AWS CodeBuild and is therefore not the best option. INCORRECT: "Store build artifacts on Amazon S3 with default encryption enabled and move Jenkins to an Auto Scaling group" is incorrect. Moving Jenkins to an Auto Scaling group does not reduce the operational management. This is also an option that requires more overhead to manage compared to using a managed service such as AWS CodeBuild. INCORRECT: "Add a build action using AWS CodePipeline and encrypt the artifacts using AWS Certification Manager (ACM)" is incorrect. Artifacts cannot be encrypted using ACM as that is a service that issues SSL/TLS certificates which are used for encryption in-transit rather than encryption at-rest.

    explanation: 'The AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) helps migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. With AWS DMS the data can be continuously replicated with high availability and the multiple databases can be consolidated into a petabyte-scale data warehouse. The Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same AWS account and the same AWS Region as the replication instance. During a database migration to Amazon Redshift, AWS DMS first moves data to an Amazon S3 bucket. When the files reside in an Amazon S3 bucket, AWS DMS then transfers them to the proper tables in the Amazon Redshift data warehouse. AWS DMS creates the S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the Amazon Redshift database. CORRECT: "Use AWS Database Migration Service to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Use AWS Glue to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift" is incorrect. AWS Glue is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. INCORRECT: "Use Amazon EMR to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift" is incorrect. Amazon EMR (previously called Amazon Elastic MapReduce) is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. INCORRECT: "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift" is incorrect. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a fully managed, serverless data streaming service that stores and ingests various streaming data in real time at any scale. It is not suitable for migrating data between databases. References: https://aws.amazon.com/dms/ Save time with our AWS cheat sheets: https://digitalcloud.training/aws-migration-services/'

Each day the development team create new buckets for projects they are working on, and all existing and future buckets must be secured.

    ],
    correct: ['B'],
    explanation: 'You can use the AWS Config Auto Remediation feature to auto remediate any non-compliant S3 buckets using the AWS Config rules. There are several pre-built rules you can leverage for various use cases. For example, the following rules can be used to meet the requirements specified in this question: s3-bucket-logging-enabled s3-bucket- server-side-encryption-enabled s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited s3-bucket-public-write- prohibited These rules act as controls to prevent any non-compliant S3 activities. AWS Config uses AWS Systems Manager to implement the remediations and the rules are automation documents that Systems Manager runs. CORRECT: "Enable AWS Config rules and configure automatic remediation using AWS Systems Manager documents" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Enable AWS Trusted Advisor and configure automatic remediation using Amazon CloudWatch Events" is incorrect. Trusted Advisor will not discover these specific compliance events and CloudWatch Events is not able to remediate them. INCORRECT: "Enable AWS Systems Manager and configure automatic remediation using Systems Manager documents" is incorrect. Systems Manager automation documents are used for remediation, but Systems Manager is unable to discover the specific compliance events for this scenario. AWS Config should be used with Systems Manager to meet the requirements. INCORRECT: "Enable AWS CloudTrail and configure automatic remediation using AWS Lambda" is incorrect. CloudTrail can only detect API actions rather than audit compliance with configuration requirements. Though it is possible to use CloudTrail to detect some configuration changes this would be complex to implement.

    ],
    correct: ['C'],
    explanation: 'You can use Amazon EventBridge rules to react to API calls made by an AWS service that are recorded by AWS CloudTrail. The "AWS API call via CloudTrail" event pattern can be configured to specifically trigger when the API calls are made to assume the administrator IAM role. Then, an AWS Lambda function can be triggered that processes the information received in the event and publishes this information to an Amazon SNS topic. The security team will be subscribers to the SNS topic and so will receive the notifications in their email inbox. CORRECT: "Create an Amazon EventBridge events rule with an AWS API call via CloudTrail event pattern that triggers an AWS Lambda function that publishes a notification to an Amazon SNS topic if the administrator IAM role is assumed" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Create an Amazon EventBridge events rule with an AWS Management Console sign-in events event pattern that triggers an AWS Lambda function that publishes a notification to an Amazon SNS topic if the administrator IAM role is assumed" is incorrect. Management console sign-in events are different to assuming a role. In this case the users will be signing in with their own accounts and then assuming the administrator IAM role so this would not detect the assuming of the role. INCORRECT: "Configure AWS Config to save logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to query the logs and look for AWS STS sign-in events. Publish a notification to Amazon Kinesis Firehose if the administrator IAM role is assumed" is incorrect. AWS Config does not log STS sign-in events. These would be logged as API calls in the AWS CloudTrail service and would need to be picked up there. There is also no mechanism for alerting that would work here as Firehose would simply load the data to a datastore and would not notify anyone. INCORRECT: "Configure Amazon GuardDuty to monitor the account and alert on any anomalous usage of the administrator IAM role. When detected, publish a notification to an AWS CloudTrail trail" is incorrect. GuardDuty cannot be configured to alert when a specific role is assumed. Also, you cannot publish a notification to an AWS CloudTrail trail, use SNS instead.

    explanation: 'Auto Scaling processes can be suspended and then resumed. You might want to do this, for example, so that you can investigate a configuration issue that is causing the process to fail, or to prevent Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from marking instances unhealthy and replacing them while you are making changes to your Auto Scaling group. In this scenario the engineer wants to test the instances before directing traffic to them whilst keeping them in the auto scaling group. The best process to suspend in this case is AddToLoadBalancer. This will prevent the instances from being added to the load balancer so no traffic will be directed to them. CORRECT: "Suspend the process AddToLoadBalancer" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Suspend the process Health Check" is incorrect. This will stop all health checks from running. This may not have the desired effect as instances will not be marked as healthy. INCORRECT: "Suspend the process Replace Unhealthy" is incorrect. This is useful if you want to ensure that unhealthy instances are not terminated and replaced. INCORRECT: "Suspend the process AZ Rebalance" is incorrect.
