    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities) standardizes defect rate so processes with different output volumes can be compared. Cp/Cpk are capability indices; OEE is overall equipment effectiveness.' },

    explanation: 'The 5 Whys is a simple iterative interrogative technique to drill from a symptom to the underlying root cause. Pareto charts identify vital few causes; histograms show distributions; run charts show data over time.' },
