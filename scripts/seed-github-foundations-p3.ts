      { id: 'D', text: 'Pull request template provides guidance and structure a contributor should include when creating a pull request.' }
    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Pull request templates allow organizations to provide guidance and structure for pull requests on GitHub, by providing example and default text when a pull request is created. Pull request templates are useful to make sure to follow a standard process for every pull request and often include a to-do list for the author to check before requesting a review. **************** WRONG ANSWERS: A pull request template serves as a starting point, providing a predefined structure and guidance for the information that should be included, but contributors have the flexibility to customize and add or remove content contained in the template based on the specifics of their change. Pull request templates are generated when a new pull request is created. Pull request templates are chosen but rather provided when a pull request is open. https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using- templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates#pull- request-templates'

You can star repositories and topics to discover similar projects on GitHub. When you star repositories or topics, GitHub may recommend related content on your personal dashboard. Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of GitHub\'s repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. In addition, Explore GitHub shows popular repositories based on the number of stars they have. ****************** WRONG ANSWER: While starring can contribute to organization through lists, it is not the primary purpose.

You can use this chart to view progress, spot trends, and identify bottlenecks to help move the project forward. Note that all of these are types of Historical Charts in Project insights....as opposed to the only other option which are Current Charts. ******************** WRONG ANSWERS: The Velocity Chart is more focused on showing the amount of work completed in each iteration or time period, not specifically tracking changes to the state of items over time. Cumulative Flow Diagrams visualize the flow of work items through different stages but may not provide the specific categorization mentioned in the documentation. Contribution Graphs showcase individual or team contributions over time and are not specifically related to tracking changes in the state of project items. https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/viewing-insights-from-your- project/about-insights-for-projects'

Clone: To download a full copy of a repository\'s data from GitHub.com, including all versions of every file and folder. Fork: A new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository. Merge: To take the changes from one branch and apply them to another.

Other features are permanently enabled, including dependency graph and secret scanning alerts for partners. **************** WRONG ANSWERS: GitHub allows you to enable or disable the ability to receive alerts for vulnerabilities that affect your dependencies and manually generate Dependabot pull requests to resolve these vulnerabilities Some public repositories configure security advisories so that anyone can report security vulnerabilities directly and privately to the maintainers. Owners and administrators of public repositories can enable or disable private vulnerability reporting on their repositories. Secret scanning alerts for users are available for free on all public repositories, and for private and internal repositories that are owned by organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud with a license for GitHub Advanced Security. When you enable secret scanning for a repository, GitHub scans the code for patterns that match secrets used by many service providers.

Assignees are individuals assigned to specific issues or tasks, but they do not serve the purpose of organizing tasks into groups or phases within GitHub Projects. Issues represent individual tasks or items to be addressed.

If you use GitHub Free, private repositories owned by your personal account have a limited feature set. You can upgrade to GitHub Pro to get a full feature set for private repositories. ********* WRONG ANSWERS: you cannot sign into an organization. Instead, each person signs into their own personal account, and any actions the person takes on organization resources are attributed to their personal account only GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server include enterprise accounts there\'s no such thing as a "paid" account. However, a personal account can pay for GitHub Pro for additional features, but it\'s still called a personal account https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github- accounts'

While providing ownership permissions would provide access, it could compromise security by providing excessive permissions on the code repository. The repository owner has full control of the repository. In addition to the actions that any collaborator can perform, the repository owner can perform the following actions. Sharing login credentials is a security risk and goes against best practices. GitHub provides a secure method for collaboration through invitations and access permissions.

Collaborators on a personal repository can pull (read) the contents of the repository and push (write) changes to the repository. If you require more granular access to a repository owned by your personal account, consider transferring the repository to an organization. **************** WRONG ANSWERS: Organization owners can assign roles to individuals and teams giving them different sets of permissions in the organization. Billing Managers have access to billing settings for the organization. They can view invoices, update payment methods, and manage the organization\'s subscription. The billing manager role is only available for GitHub organizations. Repository-level roles give organization members, outside collaborators and teams of people varying levels of access to repositories. The triage role is recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues, discussions, and pull requests without write access. This role is only available on organization repositories.

The MIT license carries very few restrictions on what can be done with the source code, which makes it the most permissive and widely used free license.
