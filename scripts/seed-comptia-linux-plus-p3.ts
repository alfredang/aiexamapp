Private keys are also used to create digital signatures by encrypting a hash of the sent data. The public key refers to one-half of a user key pair under the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This key is available to any user who wants to encrypt a message to a specific individual. The message can only be decrypted by the recipient\'s private key. A certificate authority (CA) is a server that issues digital certificates for entities and maintains the associated private/public key pair. Internal CAs issue self-signed certificates--certificates that are owned by the same entity that signs them.
