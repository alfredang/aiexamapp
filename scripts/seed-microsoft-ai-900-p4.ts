The mean squared error helps take the magnitude of errors into account, but because it squares the error values, the resulting metric no longer represents the quantity measured by the label. In other words, we can say that the MSE of our model is 6, but that doesn\'t measure its accuracy in terms of the number of ice creams that were mis predicted; 6 is just a numeric score that indicates the level of error in the validation predictions.
