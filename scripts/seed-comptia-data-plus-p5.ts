The empirical rule refers to the tendency of most data points falling within three points of the mean either on the positive side or the negative side of the curve. Parametric data exists when the data set is within the rules of normal distribution. Non-parametric data exists when the data is not within the rules of normal distribution, with values that frequently deviate from the mean.

Sans serif fonts do not have edges or lines and can be useful for stylistic purposes when text is larger. Style guides commonly are branding guidelines for an organization. These may contain different variations of an organization\'s logo and guidelines for how it can be used, along with color schemes, fonts, and naming conventions. Captioning allows an analyst to designate more meaningful names for fields in a report or dashboard.

The owner also normally selects a steward and custodian, delegates their actions, sets a budget and allocates resources for sufficient controls. Data has a lifecycle. It\'s created, stored, used, archived, and deleted.

Leading questions prompt certain responses or sway the survey results based on word choices, tone, and how the question is framed. This is detrimental to quality data and research and should always be avoided. With a single choice question, someone could only respond with a single answer, such as yes or no.

A goodness of fit tests a single variable and the test of independence is used to test multiple variables. A chi-square statistic compares the size of the difference between an expected result and the actual result. This measures how a model compares to the actual data.

A scatter plot consists of two variables plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, with a dot placed on the graph where the two data points converge on both of the axes. Scatter plots help analysts determine if there is a relationship between the two variables placed on the axes, and are especially useful to spot outliers in a data set. A histogram is similar to a column chart but has the ability to show the frequency of values that are grouped by bins, or class intervals. Each bin is placed on the x- axis with the y-axis holding the assessed value. A line graph, or run chart, uses a single horizontal line or a group of multiple lines to represent different data points at different times. This is typically used when an analyst wants to display time-series data, or data over intervals of time because the connected line makes it easier to see how that data changes over time.'

This is similar to transaction processing, but it does not need the same level of accuracy in its results. Batch processing is used when processing a large amount of data when accuracy is more important than speed. Batch processing will process the data in batches, saving on the resource costs that are allocated for processing. Multiprocessing uses two or more processors to work on a single data set. This allows faster processing for exceptionally large data sets. This is more expensive than other processing options because of the machine expenses and overall volume or memory needed for it to function properly. Distributed processing takes large-volume data sets and distributes them across multiple servers. This is done to build redundancy into the system so that if a server fails, another server can continue its processes.'
