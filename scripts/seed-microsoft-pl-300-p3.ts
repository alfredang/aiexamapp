    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: '<<This entire discussion is on Power BI service, NOT Power BI Desktop>> If you need to monitor and detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, you wouldn\'t manually refresh the Power BI report with a mouse click. The reports should be automatically updated as soon as a transaction is created in the database so you can take corrective action. Automatic page refresh in Power BI automatically updates the active report if the source data changes. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-automatic-page-refresh But automatic page refresh works only with data sources that support DirectQuery. Thankfully, relational data sources like Teradata support DirectQuery. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-automatic-page-refresh#considerations-and-limitations https://docs.microsoft.com/en- us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-directquery-about#determining-the-queries-sent-by-power-bi-desktop This means that both the options related to Import models are incorrect. You can safely ignore the options Use Import as Data Connectivity mode with Premium capacity and Use Import as Data Connectivity mode with shared capacity. For workspaces in shared capacity, automatic page refresh has a minimum refresh interval of 30 minutes. Refreshing the report once in 30 minutes is not ideal as you need to quickly remediate any fraudulent transaction. The option Use DirectQuery as Data Connectivity mode with shared capacity is incorrect too. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-automatic-page-refresh#restrictions-on- refresh-intervals For workspaces in Premium capacity, automatic page refresh has a minimum refresh interval as low as 1 second (even in Power BI service). Since we need to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, you can set the interval as low as allowed by the capabilities of the data source and the capacity administrator. Option Use DirectQuery as Data Connectivity mode with Premium capacity is the correct answer.

Or, in other words, how a change in one variable affects the other. In addition to that, a scatter chart helps us to find clusters automatically in the dataset. This capability will help us in finding high-performing product categories for Koovs. Once we create a scatter chart with the Average of No. of. answered questions and Average of No. of. ratings on the X- and Y- axis, and Product Category in the Details well, you can use the Automatically find clusters feature (by clicking ... on the chart) to identify product category clusters in the dataset. From the scatter chart, we can observe three groups of data. So, let\'s instruct the clustering algorithm to find three clusters. We get three clusters (coded in different colors) as the output. For finding clusters, the algorithm does the following: 1. Creates a categorical field (with cluster groups) 2. This field is added to the scatter chart\'s Legend well 3. This categorical field color codes the three different clusters. Cluster 2 indicates the high-performing product categories (which have a high average value for both the metrics). Option Scatter chart is the correct choice. Reference Link: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-desktop-november- feature-summary/#analytics The option Line chart is incorrect. Although very similar to scatter charts, we use line charts to view trends or track changes over time, not to understand relationships between variables.

The Tile background changes do not affect one of the tiles because the tile must be using a report theme. In this case, none of the dashboard theme changes affects the tile. Option The tile uses a report theme is the correct answer. When you pin a report tile (with a custom theme or any of the built-in themes except Default or Classic) to a dashboard, Power BI displays a Tile Theming option to either: � Let the tile retain the report theme � Use the dashboard theme. If you retain the current report theme, the dashboard theme changes will NOT affect the tile. Option The tile uses a custom theme is incorrect as the user could choose to use a destination theme as well, in which case the dashboard theme changes apply to the visual. The option The tile uses a dashboard theme is incorrect. If the tile uses a dashboard theme, all the theme changes at the dashboard level shall be updated. The option The tile uses a built-in theme is also incorrect.

    explanation: 'If we analyze Sales Amount by Supplier Name (from the Supplier table), we get repeating numbers for Sales Amount (an indication that something is wrong with the data model). So, option No change is required is incorrect. The reason for these repeating numbers is that the Supplier Name filters are not carried all the way through to the Sales table (For Many-to-one relationships, filters propagate only from the one-side). As seen from the image, the Supplier table filters the Supplier_Product table. But from there, the filters aren\'t carried to the Product table. 1. Each cell sends a query to calculate the total sales amount (for that supplier). 2. But, since the filters do not flow from Supplier_Product to the Product table, the Product table is unfiltered. 3. So, for each cell value (supplier), all the values in the Sales Amount column are summed up. Therefore, you get the same value for each supplier. From the above explanation, it is evident that we need to set the Cross-filter direction between the Product and the Supplier_Product table to Both. Doing so enables the filters to flow easily across the data model. The report should now show correct Sales Amount values for each supplier. A similar example is given in Microsoft documentation. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/relationships-many-to-many#relate-many-to-many- dimensions The remaining two options are incorrect because there is no need to set bidirectional filters between other pairs of tables in the data model.

The option Convert the Excel file to a Text/CSV. Then import the data using a parameter is incorrect. Option Create a new query that uses the parameter is incorrect too. Creating a new query doesn\'t change the fact that you cannot use parameters with Excel data. However, you can still parameterize Excel data source connections after importing the data into the Power BI model. To demonstrate this, first, create a Power Query parameter with the Current Value of the parameter as the location of the Excel file. 1. Next, navigate to the APPLIED STEPS for the Excel query, and select the settings icon next to the Source step. 2. Change the File path from \'Text\' to \'Parameter.\' 3.

Or granting Viewer access to the workspace. Since granting users/groups access to individual reports will give read-only access, the solution (in option B) meets the goals.

If the condition is TRUE, we output blank values using the BLANK () function (we display [Total Sales] if condition returns FALSE, per the question).

Reference Link: https://dax.guide/if/ https://dax.guide/blank/ https://dax.guide/isblank/ ISFILTERED returns TRUE when there is a direct filter on the column/table. ISCROSSFILTERED returns TRUE when the column/table is cross-filtered. i.e., filtered by other columns in the table or related tables via relationships. ISCROSSFILTERED is incorrect because: 1. Using the argument Dates (a table), the ISCROSSFILTERED function returns TRUE if the user filters the report by any column in the Dates table (not just the Date column). For example, using the month filter will filter the entire Dates table. The given formula outputs blank values (undesired). 2. Using the argument Dates[Date] (a column) also, the ISCROSSFILTERED function returns TRUE if the user filters the report by any column in the Dates table (not just the Date column). For example, using the month filter will filter all the columns in the Dates table and still outputs blank values. 3. Finally, using any column from the Sales Order table, the ISCROSSFILTERED function always returns TRUE even before you apply any filter. This is because there is a filter (Rep) in the filter context in the table visual. On the contrary, you can use the ISFILTERED function to check if the report is filtered by a specific column. If you use ISFILTERED, you can only use the Dates[Date] column as its argument, since we need to output blank values only if the report is filtered by the Date Column from the Dates table. We cannot use the Dates table too (Check the PBIX File). If this filter is removed, you should see the correct Sales Value (honoring other filters).

    explanation: 'First, let\'s understand the reasons why we need to create a relationship between both the tables: Requirement 1: The State Province column is in the City table, and a city\'s orders data is in the Order table. Requirement 2: The State Province column is in the City table, and the Quantity column is in the Order table. So, a relationship between the tables is necessary to meet the requirement. The City table has unique US cities with City Key as the primary key. The Orders table has unique orders placed in the US with the Order key as the primary key. Since the company can receive orders from multiple clients in a city, multiple orders can be placed from a single city. So, we can relate both the tables by City Key. By default, Power BI creates a single-directional, many-to-one relationship from Order to City. Let\'s try creating a visual for the given requirement: Requirement 1: The count of cities where at least an order is placed for each State Province in January 2015. Requirement 2: The all-time percentage contribution of a State Province to the total quantities ordered in the US. So, box 1 -> City Key and box 2 -> Many-to-one. Since we can satisfy the requirement by using a single- directional filter, box 3 -> Single. We do not need to use bidirectional filters as can it lead to performance issues and ambiguous results.

    explanation: 'Realize that both options A and D are the same formulas. When we write the condition (\'Work Orders\'[District] = "North") as a filter argument of the CALCULATE function, DAX internally converts the condition into a table filter (FILTER ( ALL ( \'Work Orders\'[District] ), \'Work Orders\'[District] = "North") Reference Link: https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/introducing-calculate-in-dax/ Since they produce the same output, let\'s understand how they work by analyzing the filter expression of option D. For District = Central: 1. Before evaluating the DAX formula, we have District (Central) in the filter context. 2. But the ALL function removes the filter on the district column. The ALL function ignores any filters. 3. The CALCULATE function then applies its internal filter District = North. 4. So, we get Sales value (of the north district) for every district. Since we get repeating sales values for all districts, both options A and D are incorrect. Option C is a modified DAX formula of option D. Here is how the formula works, for example, for evaluating the measure for the Central District: 1. Instead of the district column, the FILTER function iterates the entire table. Further, there is no ALL function on the table. So, it does not override any existing filter in the filter context. 2. For computing the sales value, the CALCULATE\'s filter (District = North) gets added to the existing filter (District = Central) in the filter context. 3. The intersection of the two filters is null, as there are no rows in the table where the district is both North and Central. So, we get null values for all the districts except the north (the intersection of north and north is north). Since this is the precise requirement, option C is one of the correct answers. Option B is the other correct choice as KEEPFILTERS also intersects rather than override existing filters in the filter context. The inner workings of KEEPFILTERS are the same as described above, and so they produce similar results. Reference Link: https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/using-keepfilters-in-dax/ Options B and C are the correct answers.

Recognize that ADDCOLUMNS is an iterator function. i.e., for each product subcategory in the virtual table, the given expression is evaluated in row context (computed once for every row). https://dax.guide/addcolumns/ Although the expression is computed for each row, AVERAGE ( Sales[Sales Amount] ) evaluates the average sales value of all the products in the Sales table. It is essential to understand that the product subcategory values in the virtual table are not in the filter context. i.e., they do not filter the expression. So, for every row in the virtual table, we get repeating values of average sales of all the products. Since we need average sales for the specific product subcategories, using this expression doesn\'t serve the purpose. Reference Link: https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/understanding-context-transition/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/calculate-function-dax#remarks https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/values-function-dax Option A is incorrect as AVERAGE ( Sales[Sales Amount] ) does not go into the first box. Option C is also incorrect for the same reason. If you use the CALCULATE function in a row context, context transition is automatic. Since ADDCOLUMNS evaluates the expression in a row context, using an explicit or implicit (introduced by a measure) CALCULATE function will force context transition to happen. i.e., row values of Product subcategory in the virtual table filter columns of the Sales table. 1. Using a measure (where CALCULATE is implicit) in a row context will force context transition. 2. The row value (Touring Bikes) filters the Product table for the relevant Product subcategories. 3. The filtered Product table filters the Sales table for the related products. So, [Average Sales] will calculate only the average sales of the specific product subcategories. [Average Sales] does go into the 1st box. To achieve the desired result, we only need to return product subcategories whose average sales are higher than the average sales of all products. Since the outer FILTER function too is an iterator, it evaluates the filter expression in row context. So, using the measure [Average Sales] in the 2nd box will force context transition (for the same reason above) and return the average sales of the currently iterating product subcategory. In the filter expression, the average sales of any subcategory are compared with itself. Since the opera'

    explanation: 'When you right-click on a visual and click Summarize, Power BI creates a new smart narrative visual that provides a quick summary of the visual. But the trends and the key takeaways are limited only to the visual, not the entire report. Reference Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-smart-narrative#smart-narrative-for-a-visual Option B is incorrect. To point out sales trends and highlight key takeaways for the entire report, use the smart narrative visual. Reference Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power- bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-smart-narrative#smart-narrative-for-a-page You can slice the smart narrative visual by any other report visual. The smart narrative visual updates to display the information specific to the chosen field. For example, below we slice the visual by the Technology category (from the pie chart). Option C is the correct answer. We add a trend line to a specific visual, for example, a clustered column chart to capture the trend. Trend lines do not highlight trends for an entire report. The output expected from the question is some kind of text information. Option A is incorrect. Reference Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-analytics-pane Power BI Q&A is a natural way to interact with your data and create report visuals.

So, irrespective of the export data setting in Desktop, None should be selected as the Export data setting in Power BI service to prevent users from exporting data from any visual. Detailed Explanation: In Power BI Desktop, you can set the Export data settings under File -> Options and settings -> Options -> Report settings (under Current File). In Power BI service, you can set the Export data settings under File -> Settings -> Under Export data section in the right pane. Using these settings, you can control the types of data exported from a Power BI visualization. 1. Data with the current layout 2. Summarized data 3. Underlying data But note that admin settings in the Power BI service always override the export settings in Power BI Desktop. Reference Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-export-data?tabs=powerbi-service#export-data-from-a-report So, export data settings in the Power BI service must be set to None to disable the Export data option for any visual. This ensures that users cannot export data from any report visual in the Power BI service. Options B and C are the correct answer choices.'
