Regression analysis is a statistical method used to estimate relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurements or goals used to identify if a business is achieving its objectives. KPIs can be used to monitor the status of products, processes, or sales goals for example.

    explanation: 'OBJ 4.1 - This supervisor endorsement is known as approval. The approval process varies between organizations, and occasionally between departments. This process ensures that only authorized personnel with a legitimate purpose for the data are able to access it. An analyst must also be aware of varied access permissions and data policies for their organization. It may be necessary to develop a way to provide reports for individuals who don\'t have access to raw data or other considerations. The audience is the people who will be using the data within your reports and dashboards. It is critical to understand what data the audience needs and what access they require to support the reporting process. A distribution list can also be described as an audience, the people who receive the report or dashboard. Before an analyst begins reporting on data, it is important for them to first gain approval to design the dashboard or report.'

A table displays columns and rows of data and can also include aggregate information. Tables are valuable for information that needs to be subtotaled or for the purpose of showing potential values of any dimension in a list format.

Non-parametric data exists when the data is not within the rules of normal distribution, with values that frequently deviate from the mean. Parametric data exists when the data set is within the rules of normal distribution. Percentage change represents the difference between a new value and an original value.

Master data serves as the single source of truth for all records in an organization and is used by people across the organization for critical business decisions. This data changes less frequently and is intended for dimension data, not transactional data. The data dictionary is a critical part of master data management and an important resource for a data analyst. This document serves as an authority on all informational definitions that have been agreed upon for the organization, as well as key metrics. This will likely contain data elements and their field attributes as well as the relationships and structure of the data. Data loss is the intentional or accidental loss of information by human error or an ineffective process. Data loss occurs when records are lost, incomplete, poorly named, or have accidentally dropped out.
