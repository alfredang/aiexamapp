A DDoS attack falls squarely within this phase as it aims to overwhelm and disrupt the system. The discovery and scanning phases are for gathering information, and post-exploitation is for actions taken after successfully gaining access or control.'

This is not typically part of a misuse test, which aims to evaluate how the application reacts to improper or malicious use cases. Misuse testing involves identifying potential threats, critical assets, and security goals, which help shape how the system is tested against abusive scenarios rather than evaluating the internal structure of the code.'

While covert channels are a concern, encapsulation increases the risk of bypassing security measures. Network segmentation and encryption, on the other hand, enhance security by controlling data flow and protecting information.'

CRLs, on the other hand, are periodically updated lists, which can lead to delays in revocation notification. OCSP minimizes this delay by directly querying the certificate authority for the current status.'

Monitoring bandwidth in real-time allows for quicker detection of such events. Polling response times or logging performance metrics, while useful, do not specifically address bandwidth anomalies caused by DDoS attacks.'

    correct: ['B'],
    explanation: 'OBJ. 5.2 - One-time passwords (OTPs) are the strongest method listed, as they are valid for only a single session or transaction and become invalid after use, significantly reducing the risk of interception or reuse. Long, complex passwords and passphrases offer good security but are more susceptible to being compromised over time. Reducing password age does not inherently improve password strength if the underlying password strategy is weak.'

    explanation: 'OBJ. 4.2 - The most significant concern with an end-of-life announcement is the increased likelihood of zero-day attacks because the vendor will no longer provide patches or security updates. This makes the network switch highly vulnerable to new exploits. Operational costs, compatibility issues, and extended support costs are important, but the security risk from unpatched vulnerabilities is far greater and poses a critical threat to the network\'s integrity.'
