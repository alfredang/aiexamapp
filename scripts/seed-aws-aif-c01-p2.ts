    explanation: 'Correct options: Semi-supervised learning is when you apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to a common problem. This technique relies on using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train systems. First, the labeled data is used to partially train the machine learning algorithm. After that, the partially trained algorithm labels the unlabeled data. This process is called pseudo- labeling. The model is then re-trained on the resulting data mix without being explicitly programmed. via - https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-machine- learning-supervised-and-unsupervised/ Fraud identification Within a large set of transactional data, there\'s a subset of labeled data where experts have confirmed fraudulent transactions. For a more accurate result, the machine learning solution would train first on the unlabeled data and then with the labeled data. Sentiment analysis When considering the breadth of an organization\'s text-based customer interactions, it may not be cost-effective to categorize or label sentiment across all channels. An organization could train a model on the larger unlabeled portion of data first, and then a sample that has been labeled. This would provide the organization with a greater degree of confidence in customer sentiment across the business. Incorrect options: Neural network - A neural network solution is a more complex supervised learning technique. To produce a given outcome, it takes some given inputs and performs one or more layers of mathematical transformation based on adjusting data weightings. An example of a neural network technique is predicting a digit from a handwritten image. Clustering - Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups certain data inputs, so they may be categorized as a whole. There are various types of clustering algorithms depending on the input data. An example of clustering is identifying different types of network traffic to predict potential security incidents. Dimensionality reduction - Dimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning technique that reduces the number of features in a dataset. It\'s often used to preprocess data for other machine learning functions and reduce complexity and overheads. For example, it may blur out or crop background features in an image recognition application.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Self-supervised learning It works when models are provided vast amounts of raw, almost entirely, or completely unlabeled data and then generate the labels themselves. Foundation models use self-supervised learning to create labels from input data. In self-supervised learning, models are provided vast amounts of raw completely unlabeled data and then the models generate the labels themselves. This means no one has instructed or trained the model with labeled training data sets. Incorrect options: Supervised learning - Reinforcement learning is a method with reward values attached to the different steps that the algorithm must go through. So the model\'s goal is to accumulate as many reward points as possible and eventually reach an end goal. Supervised learning - In supervised learning, models are supplied with labeled and defined training data to assess for correlations. The sample data specifies both the input and the output for the model. For example, images of handwritten figures are annotated to indicate which number they correspond to. A supervised learning system could recognize the clusters of pixels and shapes associated with each number, given sufficient examples. Data labeling is the process of categorizing input data with its corresponding defined output values. Labeled training data is required for supervised learning. For example, millions of apple and banana images would need to be tagged with the words "apple" or "banana." Then machine learning applications could use this training data to guess the name of the fruit when given a fruit image. Unsupervised learning - Unsupervised learning algorithms train on unlabeled data. They scan through new data, trying to establish meaningful connections between the inputs and predetermined outputs. They can spot patterns and categorize data. For example, unsupervised algorithms could group news articles from different news sites into common categories like sports, crime, etc. They can use natural language processing to comprehend meaning and emotion in the article.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Fine-tuning changes the weights of the FM whereas Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) does not change the weights of the FM Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization\'s internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. Another recommended way to first customize a foundation model to a specific use case is through prompt engineering. Providing your foundation model with well-engineered, context-rich prompts can help achieve desired results without any fine-tuning or changing of model weights. Lastly, fine-tuning is a customization method for FMs that involves further training and does change the weights of your model. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows you to customize a model\'s responses when you want the model to consider new knowledge or up-to-date information.

They generate output from one or more inputs (prompts) in the form of human language instructions. In general, an FM uses learned patterns and relationships to predict the next item in a sequence. For example, with image generation, the model analyzes the image and creates a sharper, more clearly defined version of the image. Similarly, with text, the model predicts the next word in a string of text based on the previous words and their context. It then selects the next word using probability distribution techniques.

You can complete various human-in-the-loop tasks, from data generation and annotation to reward model generation, model review, and customization through a self-service or AWS managed offering. SageMaker Ground Truth helps in creating high-quality labeled datasets by incorporating human feedback, which is crucial for training and refining reinforcement learning models. This human feedback ensures that the data used for training accurately reflects real-world scenarios, enhancing the effectiveness of RLHF. SageMaker Ground Truth includes a data annotator for RLHF capabilities. You can give direct feedback and guidance on output that a model has generated by ranking, classifying, or doing both for its responses for RL outcomes. The data, referred to as comparison and ranking data, is effectively a reward model or reward function, which is then used to train the model. You can use comparison and ranking data to customize an existing model for your use case or to fine- tune a model that you build from scratch. Incorrect options: SageMaker Ground Truth automatically generates synthetic data for training reinforcement learning models without any human intervention - SageMaker Ground Truth does not generate synthetic data automatically; it focuses on creating labeled datasets with human assistance. SageMaker Ground Truth uses pre-trained models to eliminate the need for human feedback in the reinforcement learning process - SageMaker Ground Truth leverages human feedback for labeling, rather than relying solely on pre-trained models. SageMaker Ground Truth is specifically designed for real-time decision-making in autonomous systems, bypassing the need for any data labeling - While SageMaker Ground Truth is valuable for data labeling, it is not specifically designed for real- time decision-making in autonomous systems without the need for data labeling.

This capability is crucial for optimizing the model\'s performance and ensuring it behaves as expected. They foster trust and confidence in model predictions When stakeholders can understand the decision-making process of a model, it builds trust in its predictions. Transparency is key in high-stakes scenarios, such as healthcare or finance, where understanding the rationale behind predictions is critical for acceptance and trust. Incorrect options: They require less computational power and storage - The computational and storage requirements of a model depend on its complexity and the amount of data it processes, not necessarily on its transparency. Both transparent and opaque models can vary widely in their resource needs. They enhance security by concealing model logic - Opaque models, not transparent ones, are typically associated with enhanced security through obscurity. Transparent models, by definition, reveal their internal workings, which can be less secure if the logic itself needs to be protected. They simplify the integration process with other systems - The ease of integrating a model with other systems is more related to the architecture and compatibility of the model with existing systems rather than its transparency.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud Computing can be broadly divided into three types - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. EC2 gives you full control over managing the underlying OS, virtual network configurations, storage, data, and applications. So EC2 is an example of an IaaS service. Overview of the types of Cloud Computing: via - https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/ Incorrect options: Platform as a Service (PaaS) - PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don\'t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. Elastic Beanstalk is an example of a PaaS service. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Software as a Service (SaaS) - SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don\'t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. AWS Rekognition is an example of a SaaS service.

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). Agility - Agility refers to the ability of the cloud to give you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them � from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to the Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more. Incorrect options: Elasticity - With cloud computing elasticity, you don\'t have to over-provision resources upfront to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the number of resources that you need. You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change. Cost savings - The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. Ability to deploy globally in minutes - With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Generative models focus on generating new data from learned patterns, whereas discriminative models classify data by distinguishing between different classes Generative models learn the underlying patterns of data to create new, similar data, while discriminative models learn to distinguish between different classes of data. Generative models, such as GPT-3, can generate new content, whereas discriminative models are used for classification tasks. The former focuses on understanding and replicating the data distribution, while the latter focuses on decision boundaries to classify inputs. For example, discriminative models look at images - known data like pixel arrangement, line, color, and shape -- and then map them to an outcome -- the unknown factor. Mathematically, these models work by identifying equations that could numerically map unknown and known factors as x and y variables. Generative models take this one step further. Instead of predicting a label given some features, they try to predict features given a certain label. Mathematically, generative modeling calculates the probability of x and y occurring together. It learns the distribution of different data features and their relationships. For example, generative models analyze animal images to record variables like different ear shapes, eye shapes, tail features, and skin patterns. They learn features and their relations to understand what different animals look like in general. They can then recreate new animal images that were not in the training set. Incorrect options: Discriminative models are used to generate new data, while generative models are used only for classification - Discriminative models are used primarily for classification, not for generating new data. Discriminative models are only used for text classification, while generative models are only used for image classification - Discriminative models can be used for both text and image classification, while generative models learn the underlying patterns of data to create new data. Generative models are trained on labeled data, while discriminative models can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled data - The training data type (labeled vs. unlabeled) is not the primary distinction between generative and discriminative models.

You don\'t need to spend money on building and maintaining data centers as the Cloud provider takes care of that. Allocate a few months of planning for your infrastructure capacity needs - With cloud computing, you don\'t need to guess on your infrastructure capacity needs. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes\' notice. There is no need to allocate a few months of infrastructure planning. Trade variable expense for capital expense - With cloud computing, you trade capital expense for variable expense.

    correct: ['B'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Machine Learning models can be deterministic or probabilistic or a mix of both Machine Learning models can be deterministic or probabilistic or a mix of both, depending on their nature and how they are designed to operate. Deterministic models always produce the same output given the same input. Their behavior is predictable and consistent. Example: Decision Trees: Given the same input data, a decision tree will always follow the same path and produce the same output. Probabilistic models provide a distribution of possible outcomes rather than a single output. They incorporate uncertainty and randomness in their predictions. Example: Bayesian Networks: These models represent probabilistic relationships among variables and provide probabilities for different outcomes. Some models combine both deterministic and probabilistic elements, such as neural networks and random forests. via - https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/ Incorrect options: Machine Learning models can only be probabilistic Machine Learning models can only be deterministic These two options contradict the explanation provided above, so these options are incorrect. Machine Learning models are deterministic for supervised learning and probabilistic for unsupervised learning - This option acts as a distractor. There is no correlation between the deterministic/probabilistic model and leveraging supervised/unsupervised learning. Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine- learning/'

    correct: ['D'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Reinforcement learning focuses on an agent learning optimal actions through interactions with the environment and feedback, while supervised learning involves training models on labeled data to make predictions Reinforcement learning is characterized by an agent that learns to make optimal decisions through interactions with the environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This feedback helps the agent learn a policy to maximize cumulative rewards. In contrast, supervised learning involves training models using labeled datasets to make predictions or classifications based on the input data. via - https://aws.amazon.com/what- is/reinforcement-learning/ Incorrect options: Reinforcement learning relies on learning from labeled datasets, whereas supervised learning involves an agent taking actions to receive rewards or penalties - This is incorrect, as it reverses the definitions. Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning from rewards or penalties, while supervised learning uses labeled datasets. Reinforcement learning uses unlabeled data to cluster data points, whereas supervised learning uses labeled data to make predictions - Reinforcement learning does not cluster data points; it involves learning from interaction and feedback. Supervised learning uses labeled data for making predictions. Reinforcement learning and supervised learning both require labeled datasets for training models - Only supervised learning requires labeled datasets, while reinforcement learning relies on interaction and feedback from the environment.
