    explanation: 'The responsibility for sizing the Product Backlog Items lies with the Developers. They should engage in discussions with the Product Owner to clarify the items and gain a shared understanding. Based on their technical expertise and understanding of the work, the Developers can then determine the effort or size required for each Product Backlog Item.

    explanation: 'When determining the length of a Sprint, it is important to consider the team\'s ability to learn from their work and its outcomes. The length of the Sprint should allow for a meaningful cycle of work, where the team can complete, review, and reflect on their work to gather feedback and make improvements. By having a suitable Sprint duration, the team can maximize their learning, adapt their approach, and continuously improve their processes and outcomes. While factors such as the organization\'s policy, team member availability, and release schedules may influence the Sprint length to some extent, the primary focus should be on creating a time frame that enables effective learning and iterative development.'

    explanation: 'According to the Scrum Guide, the Daily Scrum is an important event for the Developers to inspect their progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt their plan for the remainder of the Sprint. Reducing the frequency of this event could result in several negative consequences, including fewer opportunities to inspect and adapt the Sprint Backlog, an outdated Sprint Backlog, and slower identification and resolution of impediments.

However, it is also important for the Scrum Master to consider the cases in which specialists are really needed and that problem at hand is too complex for the Developers to figure out on their own. In these cases, the Scrum Master can work with the Developers with the possibility of having specialized training or even having the specialist join the Scrum Team for the period in which his/her expertise is needed. Whatever the case, keep in mind that the Scrum Master has to respect the Scrum Team\'s self-management, but fulfill his/her accountability for the Scrum Team\'s effectiveness.'
