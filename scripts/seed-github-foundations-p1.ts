    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in a collaborative environment. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously by tracking changes made to the files over time. VCS provides features such as version history, branching, and merging, which help maintain a structured development process, reduce conflicts, and enable efficient collaboration. The main goal is to ensure that changes can be tracked, reverted if necessary, and integrated seamlessly into the project, promoting a systematic and organized approach to software development. **************** Wrong Answers: VCS is not used to enforce code quality standards, as that is usually done using a different app or service VCS does not execute source code. It is designed to store different versions of the code or files VCS will not automatically fix coding errors or issues in files - it only stores the files https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git'

Helpful topics to classify a repository include the repository\'s intended purpose, subject area, community, or language. Additionally, GitHub analyzes public repository content and generates suggested topics that repository admins can accept or reject. Private repository content is not analyzed and does not receive topic suggestions. ******************** WRONG ANSWER: GitHub topics don\'t typically include license information.

    correct: ['D'],
    explanation: 'Both GitHub SAML SSO and Enterprise Managed Users can leverage an IdP for authentication. If you configure SAML SSO, members of your organization will continue to sign into their personal accounts on GitHub.com. When a member accesses most resources within your organization, GitHub redirects the member to your IdP to authenticate. With Enterprise Managed Users, you manage the lifecycle and authentication of your users on GitHub.com from an external identity management system, or IdP. **************** WRONG ANSWERS: If you configure additional SAML access restriction, each person you want to grant access to your enterprise must create and manage a personal account on GitHub.com. After you grant access to your enterprise, the member can access your enterprise\'s resources only after authenticating successfully for both the account on GitHub.com and for an account on your SAML identity provider (IdP). With authentication solely through GitHub.com, each person you want to grant access to your enterprise must create and manage a personal account on GitHub.com. After you grant access to your enterprise, the member can access your enterprise\'s resources after signing into the account on GitHub.com. Personal accounts do not use a centralized IdP, even if configured with 2FA. GitHub tests and officially support the following IdPs: Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Okta, OneLogin, PingOne, Shibboleth https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access- management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-identity-and-access-management https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access- management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-saml-for-enterprise-iam https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access- management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users'
