    explanation: 'Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, EC2 workloads, container applications, and data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) GuardDuty provides threat detection services that cover several types of activity. One of these is instance compromise as per the following description of the scope of this service: Activity indicating an instance compromise, such as cryptocurrency mining, backdoor command, and control (C&C) activity, malware using domain generation algorithms (DGA), outbound denial of service activity, unusually high network traffic volume, unusual network protocols, outbound instance communication with a known malicious IP, temporary Amazon EC2 credentials used by an external IP address, and data exfiltration using DNS. The GuardDuty findings are automatically logged to Amazon CloudWatch Events. You can then use EventBridge to create a rule that triggers an action when certain events that match the filter pattern are logged.

    explanation: 'The most likely issue is that the service role used by AWS CodeBuild does not have the correct permissions to download the data securely from the Amazon S3 bucket. CodeBuild uses the service role for all operations that are performed on your behalf. Therefore, the role must have the permissions needed during the build stage. In this case, simply adding the correct permissions statements to the policy attached to the service role should resolve the permission issue. The data can then be downloaded from S3 using the AWS CLI by specifying commands in the buildspec document. CORRECT: "Modify the service role for the CodeBuild project to include permissions for S3. Use the AWS CLI to download the data" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Configure an IAM access key and a secret access key in the application code and use the AWS CLI to download the data" is incorrect. This is an insecure method of using credentials and should be avoided. It would also not provide the permissions needed by CodeBuild as the service gets those permissions from the service role. INCORRECT: "Use an aws:Referer condition key in the CodeBuild project settings. Update the buildspec to use the AWS CLI to download the data" is incorrect. The condition key referenced is used in policies to restrict access to specific HTTP referers. This is not useful here as it does not provide any permissions to CodeBuild.

    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'The above question clearly mandates three requirements: 1. Performance- Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances in a multi-AZ configuration. Deploy an Application Load Balancer to serve traffic to the Auto Scaling group 2. Database performance- Amazon Aurora will perform better than PostgreSQL since it provides multi- master configuration and can be scaled better than RDS on a global scale. 3. Vulnerability assessment- Amazon Inspector is the right fit for the scanning. The difference between Amazon Inspector and Amazon GuardDuty is that the former "checks what happens when you actually get an attack" and the latter "analyzes the actual logs to check if a threat exists". The purpose of Amazon Inspector is to test whether you are addressing common security risks in the target AWS. Database categorization and selection parameters: � If your scaling needs are for standard/ general purpose applications, RDS is the better option. You can auto-scale the database to max capacity with just a few clicks on the AWS console. � You also have the option of Aurora Serverless that can scale up or scale down well, you have to be aware of several restrictions that apply in the Serverless mode. � If you must handle a very high volume of read/write requests, DynamoDB is a better choice. It scales seamlessly with no impact on performance. You can run these database servers in on-demand or provisioned capacity mode. If you have heavy write workloads and require more than five read replicas, Aurora is a better choice. Since Aurora uses shared storage for writer and readers, there is minimal replica lag. RDS allows only up to five replicas and the replication process is slower than Aurora. CORRECT: "Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances in a multi-AZ configuration. Deploy an Application Load Balancer to serve traffic to the Auto Scaling group. For the database, use Amazon Aurora for improved throughput in a multi-master configuration for high availability. Use Amazon Inspector to perform automatic security assessments" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances in a multi-AZ configuration.

    explanation: 'This error indicates that a dependent resource can\'t return to its original state, causing the rollback to fail (UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state). A dependent resource has likely been changed or cannot be modified. There are several possible causes of this issue which include that a dependent resource has been changed outside of the CloudFormation stack or the resource cannot be modified as the user or role that performed the update has insufficient permissions. CORRECT: "The user or role that was used to perform the stack update had insufficient permissions" is a correct answer (as explained above.) CORRECT: "Changes to resources were made outside of CloudFormation and the template was not updated" is also a correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "A change set was not created and executed prior to deploying the updated template to the stack" is incorrect. Change sets are useful but not mandatory. There is no reason that the stack update would fail to roll back because a change set had not been used. INCORRECT: "An interface VPC endpoint was not operational and CloudFormation could not update resources in the VPC" is incorrect. CloudFormation uses APIs rather than the network, so it is not reliant on interface endpoints to be able to modify resources in a VPC. INCORRECT: "Amazon EC2 instances included in the stack were updated recently using the `yum update\' command" is incorrect. This command updates the operating system with the latest patches. There is no reason that running this update would have any bearing on CloudFormation\'s ability to roll back a failed update.

    explanation: 'The DevOps engineer can add a lifecycle hook to the AWS Auto Scaling group to move instances in the Terminating state to the Terminating:Wait state. In this state, the engineer can access instances before they\'re terminated, and then troubleshoot why they were marked as unhealthy. By default, an instance remains in the Terminating:Wait state for 3600 seconds (1 hour). To increase this time, you can use the heartbeat-timeout parameter in the put-lifecycle-hook API call. The maximum time that you can keep an instance in the Terminating:Wait state is 48 hours or 100 times the heartbeat timeout, whichever is smaller. CORRECT: "Add a lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling group to move instances in the Terminating state to the Terminating:Wait state" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Suspend the AZRebalance auto scaling process to prevent instances from being terminated" is incorrect. This would not stop instances that are unhealthy from being terminated. This simply prevents Auto Scaling rebalancing the instances across AZs. INCORRECT: "Take a snapshot of the attached EBS volumes. Create an image from the snapshot and launch an instance from the image" is incorrect. It may not be possible to take a snapshot from an instance that is being terminated. Also, the state of the instance would not be captured, only the contents of the EBS volume. INCORRECT: "Edit the Auto Scaling group to enable termination protection as this will protect unhealthy instances from being terminated" is incorrect.

    explanation: 'An EC2 instance is scheduled for retirement when AWS detects an irreparable failure in the infrastructure that\'s hosting your instance. You are required to stop and then start the instance at your preferred time before the instance retirement date. Stopping and starting the instance moves the instance to another healthy host. The best way to automate this process is to create a rule in Amazon EventBridge that looks for AWS Health events. The specific event is: "AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED" When this event occurs EventBridge can trigger an AWS Systems Manager automation document that stops and starts the EC2 instances. CORRECT: "Create a rule in Amazon EventBridge with AWS Health as the source and look for instance retirement scheduled events. Run an AWS Systems Manager automation document that stops and starts affected instances" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for EC2 status checks. Configure the alarm to trigger an Amazon SNS notification to the operations team and have them stop and start affected instances" is incorrect. Status checks do not inform us that an instance retirement event is scheduled, they let us know if there are issues that are affecting the instances or hosts. INCORRECT: "Enable EC2 Auto Recovery on all instances. Configure an Amazon CloudWatch alarm with the alarm action set to Recover. Specify a time for recovery that is outside of business hours" is incorrect. Auto Recovery will recover an instance automatically, but this is not related to retirement events. You also cannot configure a time schedule in the alarm action. INCORRECT: "Create a rule in Amazon EventBridge with Amazon EC2 as the source and look for EC2 instance state-change notifications that indicate the instance is shutting down.

    explanation: 'You can create custom metrics to send to Amazon CloudWatch. With custom metrics you can choose standard or high resolution and you can aggregate multiple data points and publish data as a statistic set to reduce cost and increase efficiency. Each metric is one of the following: Standard resolution, with data having a one- minute granularity. High resolution, with data at a granularity of one second. Metrics produced by AWS services are standard resolution by default. When you publish a high-resolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of 1 second, and you can read and retrieve it with a period of 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or any multiple of 60 seconds. You can aggregate your data before you publish to CloudWatch. When you have multiple data points per minute, aggregating data minimizes the number of calls to put-metric-data. Therefore, the engineer can use statistic sets to aggregate and publish the data every one minute. This is the most cost-effective solution that meets the requirements. CORRECT: "Use a custom Amazon CloudWatch metric and configure a statistic set that aggregates data points and publishes the data every 1-minute" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Use a default CloudWatch metric with a high resolution, aggregate multiple data points, and publish the data every 1-minute" is incorrect. You cannot use high resolution with a default CloudWatch metric and a default CloudWatch metric would not be available for the application availability data. INCORRECT: "Use a custom Amazon CloudWatch metric with a high resolution and publish the data every 10 seconds" is incorrect. This would be less efficient and more costly as the put-metric-data API action would be run every 10 seconds. Fewer API calls means lower cost so aggregating into a statistic set is better and publishing every 1- minute. INCORRECT: "Use a default CloudWatch metric with a standard resolution, use a dimension to publish data sets every 1-minute" is incorrect. There would not be a default metric available that uses the data returned from the application availability script.

CORRECT: "Modify the deployment script to create a /health-check.php file at the end of the deployment and modify the health check path to point to that file" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Modify the deployment script to create a /health-check.php file at the beginning of the deployment and modify the health check path to point to that file" is incorrect. This solution creates the health-check.php file too early in the process. The application may not be ready at this point so if the file is present the 200 response codes will be returned, and the instance will be marked as healthy despite the application not being ready to process requests. The question indicates that errors have been experienced due to the application being marked as healthy too early. INCORRECT: "Increase the instance grace period from 60 seconds to 300 seconds, and the consecutive health check requirement from 2 to 3" is incorrect. The grace period helps Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling distinguish unhealthy instances from newly launched instances that are not yet ready to serve traffic. This grace period can prevent Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from marking InService instances as unhealthy and terminating them before they have time to finish initializing. The issue experienced is not related to instances being terminated too early, it is related to instances coming online (marked as healthy) too early.

These hooks let you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs. A popular use of lifecycle hooks is to control when instances are registered with Elastic Load Balancing.

Also, with an ALB you can only use HTTP or HTTPS for health checks, so the configuration is not even possible. INCORRECT: "Configure an alarm in Amazon CloudWatch that monitors memory utilization and sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic when memory utilization is high" is incorrect. CloudWatch does collect memory utilization metrics from EC2 instances by default. You must use the CloudWatch agent.
