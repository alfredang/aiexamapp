    explanation: 'A database is an object held within a serverless SQL pool to hold data and metadata objects. A DATA SOURCE provides the connection information to the files in a data lake store. An EXTERNAL TABLE creates the table object without selecting data into it. A FILE FORMAT is the structure of a file that tells a program how to display its contents. The OPENROWSET is used to read the data in files stored in a data lake. The ROWSET is not a valid function. Transform data files with the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT statement Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools can be used to run SQL statements that transform data and persist the results as a file in a data lake for further processing or querying. If you\'re familiar with Transact-SQL syntax, you can craft a SELECT statement that applies the specific transformation you\'re interested in, and store the results of the SELECT statement in a selected file format with a metadata table schema that can be queried using SQL. You can use a CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT (CETAS) statement in a dedicated SQL pool or serverless SQL pool to persist the results of a query in an external table, which stores its data in a file in the data lake. The CETAS statement includes a SELECT statement that queries and manipulates data from any valid data source (which could be an existing table or view in a database, or an OPENROWSET function that reads file-based data from the data lake). The results of the SELECT statement are then persisted in an external table, which is a metadata object in a database that provides a relational abstraction over data stored in files. By applying this technique, you can use SQL to extract and transform data from files or tables, and store the transformed results for downstream processing or analysis. Subsequent operations on the transformed data can be performed against the relational table in the SQL pool database or directly against the underlying data files. Creating external database objects to support CETAS To use CETAS expressions, you must create the following types of object in a database for either a serverless or dedicated SQL pool. When using a serverless SQL pool, create these objects in a custom database (created using the CREATE DATABASE statement), not the built- in database. External data source An external data source encapsulates a connection to a file system location in a data lake. You can then use this connection to specify a relative path in which the data files for the external table'

To switch data from one partitioned table to another in Azure Synapse Analytics, you can use the ALTER TABLE ... SWITCH statement. This operation moves a partition from one table to another without physically moving the data, making it very efficient. Here\'s an example of how you might write the code to switch a partition from a source table (SalesFact) to a target table (SalesFact_Work): Step 1: Create an empty target table with the same schema First, you create the target table (SalesFact_Work) with the same schema as SalesFact. sqlCopy code CREATE TABLE SalesFact_Work WITH ( CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX, DISTRIBUTION = HASH(CustomerID), -- Adjust distribution key as per your schema PARTITION BY RANGE (DateColumn) -- Partitioning column same as SalesFact ) AS SELECT * FROM SalesFact WHERE 1 = 0; -- Create the table with the same schema, but without any data Step 2: Switch the partition from SalesFact to SalesFact_Work Next, you switch the partition containing the stale data from SalesFact to SalesFact_Work. sqlCopy code ALTER TABLE SalesFact SWITCH PARTITION <partition_number> TO SalesFact_Work PARTITION <partition_number>; Replace <partition_number> with the actual partition number you want to switch.

    correct: ['C'],
    explanation: 'In the scenario, where only doctors and nurses should have access to medical records while preventing the billing department from viewing this data, Role- Based Access Control (RBAC) combined with Row-Level Security (RLS) would typically be the best security approach in Azure Synapse. "Records" describes the data as Row Level. ChatGPT also proves that the the answer is Row Level Security and RBAC is correct answer. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC allows you to assign permissions to specific roles within your Azure Synapse environment. By assigning doctors and nurses to a specific role that has access to medical records, and ensuring the billing department is assigned to a different role with restricted access, you can effectively control who can access sensitive data. RBAC works at the Azure Synapse workspace level and controls access to resources, like databases and tables, based on roles. Row-Level Security (RLS): RLS goes a step further by restricting access to rows within a table based on the user\'s role. For example, doctors and nurses would only be able to see rows of data containing medical records, while the billing department would not be able to see those rows at all. RLS is implemented through security predicates, which are conditions added to the database tables to filter data based on the user\'s role or identity." Note: An important thing to note in the official exam questions is that there may be more that one available response that would work, but they often ask which is the best. While this may seem subjective, it is a real scenario you will likely encounter in the exam. Column level security in Azure Synapse Analytics Generally speaking, column level security is simplifying a design and coding for the security in your application. It allows you to restrict column access in order to protect sensitive data. For example, if you want to ensure that a specific user \'Leo\' can only access certain columns of a table because he\'s in a specific department. The logic for \'Leo\' only to access the columns specified for the department he works in, is a logic that is located in the database tier, rather on the application level data tier. If he needs to access data from any tier, the database should apply the access restriction every time he tries to access data from another tier. The reason for doing so, is to make sure that your security is reliable and robust since we\'re reducing the surface area of the overall security system. Column level se'

Sometimes you will run into questions that are intended to trick you. More of a question of grammar than actual Azure knowledge. The question is asking which of the listed DO NOT support Private networks. They all do, therefore \'None of the listed options DO NOT support Private networks\', which is the same as saying \'All the options DO support Private networks\'. This question is intended to trip you up so you read what is being asked. You may come across questions in your exam intended to trick you and you must read the question thoroughly. In Data Factory, an activity defines the action to be performed. A linked service defines a target data store or a compute service. An integration runtime provides the infrastructure for the activity and linked services. Integration Runtime is referenced by the linked service or activity, and provides the compute environment where the activity either runs on or gets dispatched from. This way, the activity can be performed in the region closest possible to the target data store or compute service in the most performant way while meeting security and compliance needs. In short, the Integration Runtime (IR) is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory. It provides the following data integration capabilities across different network environments, including: Data Flow: Execute a Data Flow in managed Azure compute environment. Data movement: Copy data across data stores in public network and data stores in private network (on-premises or virtual private network). It provides support for built-in connectors, format conversion, column mapping, and performant and scalable data transfer. Activity dispatch: Dispatch and monitor transformation activities running on a variety of compute services such as Azure Databricks, Azure HDInsight, Azure Machine Learning, Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, and more. SSIS package execution: Natively execute SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages in a managed Azure compute environment.

    stem: 'Scenario: You are working as a consultant at Avengers Security. At the moment, you are consulting with Tony, the lead of the IT team and the topic of discussion is about altering a table in an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool based on some specific requirements. Happy Hogan, the lead developer, has created a table by using the following Transact-SQL statement. CREATE TABLE [dbo].

It must ensure that users can identify the current manager of any employee. 2. It must support creating an employee reporting hierarchy for the entire company. 3.

      { id: 'D', text: '[DimEmployee] [int] NULL' }
    ],
    correct: ['B'],
    explanation: '[ManagerEmployeeKey] [int] NULL is the correct line to add to the table. In dimensions we use surrogates. If [ManagerEmployeeID] [int] NULL is used to create a hierarchy, at the time of the insert we can\'t guarantee that the manager is already inserted and thus we can\'t resolve the EmployeeKey of the manager, because it is an identity. Hierarchies, in tabular models, are metadata that define relationships between two or more columns in a table. Hierarchies can appear separate from other columns in a reporting client field list, making them easier for client users to navigate and include in a report. Benefits Tables can include dozens or even hundreds of columns with unusual column names in no apparent order. This can lead to an unordered appearance in reporting client field lists, making it difficult for users to find and include data in a report. Hierarchies can provide a simple, intuitive view of an otherwise complex data structure. For example, in a Date table, you can create a Calendar hierarchy. Calendar Year is used as the top-most parent level, with Month, Week, and Day included as child levels (Calendar Year->Month->Week->Day). This hierarchy shows a logical relationship from Calendar Year to Day. A client user can then select Calendar Year from a Field List to include all levels in a PivotTable, or expand the hierarchy, and select only particular levels to be included in the PivotTable. Because each level in a hierarchy is a representation of a column in a table, the level can be renamed. While not exclusive to hierarchies (any column can be renamed in a tabular model), renaming hierarchy levels can make it easier for users to find and include levels in a report. Renaming a level does not rename the column it references; it simply makes the level more identifiable. In our Calendar Year hierarchy example, in the Date table in Data View, the columns: CalendarYear, CalendarMonth, CalendarWeek, and CalendarDay were renamed to Calendar Year, Month, Week, and Day to make them more easily identifiable. Renaming levels has the additional benefit of providing consistency in reports, since users will less likely need to change column names to make them more readable in PivotTables, charts, etc. Hierarchies can be included in perspectives. Perspectives define viewable subsets of a model that provide focused, business-specific, or application-specific viewpoints of the model. A perspective, for example, could provide users a viewable list (hierarchy) of only '

It allows users to delete unwanted data from tables. The INSERT statement, used to add new rows of data into a table, is compatible with the Dedicated consumption model in Synapse SQL. It allows users to insert data into tables for storage and analysis. Control of flow statements, such as IF-ELSE and CASE statements, are compatible with the Dedicated consumption model in Synapse SQL. These statements allow for conditional logic and branching in query execution. The UPDATE statement, used to modify existing data in a table based on specified conditions, is supported in the Dedicated consumption model of Synapse SQL. It enables users to update records in tables as needed. The MERGE statement, used for inserting, updating, or deleting data in a target table based on the results of a join with a source table, is supported in the Dedicated consumption model of Synapse SQL. Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, including CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements for defining and modifying database objects like tables, views, and indexes, are supported in the Dedicated consumption model of Synapse SQL.

The result is an analytical data store that offers many of the advantages of a relational database system with the flexibility of data file storage in a data lake. Get Started with Delta Lake Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that adds relational database semantics to Spark-based data lake processing. Delta Lake is supported in Azure Synapse Analytics Spark pools for PySpark, Scala, and .NET code. The benefits of using Delta Lake in Azure Databricks include: - Relational tables that support querying and data modification. With Delta Lake, you can store data in tables that support CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations. In other words, you can select, insert, update, and delete rows of data in the same way you would in a relational database system. - Support for ACID transactions. Relational databases are designed to support transactional data modifications that provide atomicity (transactions complete as a single unit of work), consistency (transactions leave the database in a consistent state), isolation (in-process transactions can\'t interfere with one another), and durability (when a transaction completes, the changes it made are persisted). Delta Lake brings this same transactional support to Spark by implementing a transaction log and enforcing serializable isolation for concurrent operations. - Data versioning and time travel. Because all transactions are logged in the transaction log, you can track multiple versions of each table row, and even use the time travel feature to retrieve a previous version of a row in a query. - Support for batch and streaming data. While most relational databases include tables that store static data, Spark includes native support for streaming data through the Spark Structured Streaming API. Delta Lake tables can be used as both sinks (destinations) and sources for streaming data. - Standard formats and interoperability. The underlying data for Delta Lake tables is stored in Parquet format, which is commonly used in data lake ingestion pipelines.'

The correct answer is "Globally unique" because in the context of Microsoft Azure, a storage account name must be unique not only within your own subscription or resource group but across all Azure subscriptions worldwide. This ensures that each storage account can be uniquely identified and accessed without conflicts. The choice "Unique within your Azure subscription" is not the correct answer because the uniqueness of a storage account name extends beyond just the boundaries of your own subscription. The requirement for a storage account name in Azure is that it must be globally unique to prevent naming conflicts across all Azure resources. The choice "None of the listed options" is not the correct answer as the specific requirement for a storage account name in Microsoft Azure is that it must be globally unique, as stated in choice A.

It also integrates seamlessly with operational stores and data warehouses so you can extend current data applications. Data engineering concepts These concepts underpin many of the workloads that data engineers must implement and support. Operational and analytical data Operational data is usually transactional data that is generated and stored by applications, often in a relational or non- relational database. Analytical data is data that has been optimized for analysis and reporting, often in a data warehouse. One of the core responsibilities of a data engineer is to design, implement, and manage solutions that integrate operational and analytical data sources or extract operational data from multiple systems, transform it into appropriate structures for analytics, and load it into an analytical data store (usually referred to as ETL solutions). Streaming data Streaming data refers to perpetual sources of data that generate data values in real-time, often relating to specific events. Common sources of streaming data include internet- of-things (IoT) devices and social media feeds. Data engineers often need to implement solutions that capture real-time stream of data and ingest them into analytical data systems, often combining the real-time data with other application data that is processed in batches. Data pipelines Data pipelines are used to orchestrate activities that transfer and transform data. Pipelines are the primary way in which data engineers implement repeatable extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions that can be triggered based on a schedule or in response to events. Data lakes A data lake is a storage repository that holds large amounts of data in native, raw formats. Data lake stores are optimized for scaling to massive volumes (terabytes or petabytes) of data. The data typically comes from multiple heterogeneous sources, and may be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state.

The Control Plane is still hosted within a Microsoft-managed VNet, but the TLS connection is still created for you that routes traffic between both VNets. However, the network security groups (NSG) becomes customer-managed as well in this configuration. The only resource in the Data Plane that is still managed by Microsoft is the Blob Storage service that provides DBFS. Also, inter-node TLS communication between the clusters in the Data Plane is enabled in this deployment. One thing to note is that, while inter-node TLS is more secure, there is a slight impact on performance vs. the non-inter-node TLS found in a basic deployment. If your Azure Databricks workspace is deployed to your own virtual network (VNet), you can use custom routes, also known as user-defined routes (UDR), to ensure that network '

Create external database objects You can use the OPENROWSET function in SQL queries that run in the default master database of the built-in serverless SQL pool to explore data in the data lake. However, sometimes you may want to create a custom database that contains some objects that make it easier to work with external data in the data lake that you need to query frequently. Creating a database You can create a database in a serverless SQL pool just as you would in a SQL Server instance. You can use the graphical interface in Synapse Studio, or a CREATE DATABASE statement. One consideration is to set the collation of your database so that it supports conversion of text data in files to appropriate Transact-SQL data types. The following example code creates a database named salesDB with a collation that makes it easier to import UTF-8 encoded text data into VARCHAR columns. SQL CREATE DATABASE SalesDB COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8 Creating an external data source You can use the OPENROWSET function with a BULK path to query file data from your own database, just as you can in the master database; but if you plan to query data in the same location frequently, it\'s more efficient to define an external data source that references that location. For example, the following code creates a data source named files for the hypothetical https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/data/files/ folder: SQL CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE files WITH ( LOCATION = \'https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/data/files/\' ) One benefit of an external data source, is that you can simplify an OPENROWSET query to use the combination of the data source and the relative path to the folders or files you want to query: SQL SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET( BULK \'orders/*.csv\', DATA_SOURCE = \'files\', FORMAT = \'csv\', PARSER_VERSION = \'2.0\' ) AS orders In this example, the BULK parameter is used to specify the relative path for all .csv files in the orders folder, which is a subfolder of the files folder referenced by the data source.

In on-premises systems, TCO includes the following costs: - Hardware - Software licensing - Labour (installation, upgrades, maintenance) - Datacentre overhead (power, telecommunications, building, heating and cooling) It\'s difficult to align on-premises expenses with actual usage. Organizations buy servers that have extra capacity so they can accommodate future growth. A newly purchased server will always have excess capacity that isn\'t used. When an on-premises server is at maximum capacity, even an incremental increase in resource demand will require the purchase of more hardware. Because on-premises server systems are very expensive, costs are often capitalized. This means that on financial statements, costs are spread out across the expected lifetime of the server equipment. Capitalization restricts an IT manager\'s ability to buy upgraded server equipment during the expected lifetime of a server. This restriction limits the server system\'s ability to accommodate increased demand. In cloud solutions, expenses are recorded on the financial statements each month. They\'re monthly expenses instead of capital expenses. Because subscriptions are a different kind of expense, the expected server lifetime doesn\'t limit the IT manager\'s ability to upgrade to meet an increase in demand.'

How Azure manages cluster resources When you create an Azure Databricks workspace, a Databricks appliance is deployed as an Azure resource in your subscription. When you create a cluster in the workspace, you specify the types and sizes of the virtual machines (VMs) to use for both the driver and worker nodes, and some other configuration options, but Azure Databricks manages all other aspects of the cluster.

JavaScript object notation (JSON) files. Parquet files. The basic syntax for querying is the same for all of these types of file, and is built on the OPENROWSET SQL function; which generates a tabular rowset from data in one or more files. For example, the following query could be used to extract data from CSV files. SQL SELECT TOP 100 * FROM OPENROWSET( BULK \'https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/data/files/*.csv\', FORMAT = \'csv\') AS rows The OPENROWSET function includes more parameters that determine factors such as: The schema of the resulting rowset Additional formatting options for delimited text files. The output from OPENROWSET is a rowset to which an alias must be assigned. In the previous example, the alias rows is used to name the resulting rowset. The BULK parameter includes the full URL to the location in the data lake containing the data files. This can be an individual file, or a folder with a wildcard expression to filter the file types that should be included. The FORMAT parameter specifies the type of data being queried. The example above reads delimited text from all .csv files in the files folder. Note: This example assumes that the user has access to the files in the underlying store, If the files are protected with a SAS key or custom identity, you would need to create a server-scoped credential. As seen in the previous example, you can use wildcards in the BULK parameter to include or exclude files in the query. The following list shows a few examples of how this can be used: https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/data/files/file1.csv: Only include file1.csv in the files folder. https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/data/files/file*.csv: All .csv files in the files folder with names that start with "file". https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/dat'
