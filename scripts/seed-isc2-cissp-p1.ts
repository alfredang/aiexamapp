The student wants to transfer learning credits to Beta University to continue their studies in their degree program. Alpha University wants to ensure that the student records remain unchanged during the data transfer, and Beta University must confirm this upon receipt of the student\'s records. Which of the following would BEST help Alpha University accomplish this?',

When Alpha University creates a hash of the student records, Beta University can recompute the hash upon receipt to verify that the records were not altered during the transfer. Encryption and password protection secure the data but do not inherently verify its integrity, which is the primary concern in this scenario. A drop box restricts access but does not provide data verification.'

The scenario described, where a user must provide both personal details and a corporate ID number, corresponds to IAL2, which requires a moderate level of assurance in verifying the claimed identity.
