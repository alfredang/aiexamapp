Incorrect options: Scale out - The scale out (horizontal scaling) operation refers to an increase in capacity by adding more computers to the system. This is in contrast to a "scale up" operation, which is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory or storage. Horizontally scalable systems are oftentimes able to outperform vertically scalable systems by enabling parallel execution of workloads and distributing those across many different computers. Auto Scaling Group is an example of Horizontal Scaling on AWS. Scale up - The scale up (vertical scaling) operation implies adding more resources (like CPU, RAM) to a single node or machine.

AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. You can also use rate-based rules to mitigate the Web layer DDoS attack. How AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) Works: via - https://aws.amazon.com/waf/ An SQL injection attack works by exploiting any one of the known SQL vulnerabilities that allow the SQL server to run malicious code. For example, if a SQL server is vulnerable to an injection attack, it may be possible for an attacker to go to a website\'s search box and type in code that would force the site\'s SQL server to dump all of its stored usernames and passwords for the site. Similar to an SQL injection attack, a cross-site scripting attack also involves injecting malicious code into a website, but in this case, the website itself is not being attacked. Instead, the malicious code the attacker has injected only runs in the user\'s browser when they visit the attacked website, and it goes after the visitor directly, not the website. Incorrect options: Amazon GuardDuty Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS account.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Amazon MQ Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers on AWS. Amazon MQ reduces your operational responsibilities by managing the provisioning, setup, and maintenance of message brokers for you. Because Amazon MQ connects to your current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, you can easily migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code. If you\'re using messaging with existing applications, and want to move the messaging functionality to the cloud quickly and easily, AWS recommends you consider Amazon MQ. It supports industry-standard APIs and protocols so you can switch from any standards-based message broker to Amazon MQ without rewriting the messaging code in your applications. If you are building brand new applications in the cloud, AWS recommends you consider Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS. How Amazon MQ works: via - https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/ Incorrect options: Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application components and helps you build applications in which messages are processed independently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), such as automated workflows. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.

    explanation: 'Correct option: On-demand Instance - An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle -- you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. EC2 Pricing Options Overview: via - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ Incorrect options: Reserved Instance (RI) - Reserved Instance (RI) provides you with significant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three- year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. You will be charged for the entire duration, irrespective of your usage. So this option is not correct for the given use-case. Spot Instance - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.

    ],
    correct: ['D'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Amazon Rekognition Cloud Computing can be broadly divided into three types - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. Examples - Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode. PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don\'t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. Examples - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft). SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don\'t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. Examples - Amazon Rekognition, Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom. Overview of Cloud Computing Types: via - https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/ You can use Amazon Rekognition to add image and video analysis to your applications using proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology that requires no machine learning expertise.

AWS OpsWorks - AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. Chef and Puppet are automation platforms that allow you to use code to automate the configurations of your servers. OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on- premises compute environments. OpsWorks cannot auto-scale resources. AWS CloudFormation - AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all Regions and accounts. Think infrastructure as code; think CloudFormation. CloudFormation cannot auto-scale resources.

    ],
    correct: ['A', 'D'],
    explanation: 'Correct options: A "horizontally scalable" system is one that can increase capacity by adding more computers to the system. This is in contrast to a "vertically scalable" system, which is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory or storage. Horizontally scalable systems are oftentimes able to outperform vertically scalable systems by enabling parallel execution of workloads and distributing those across many different computers. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone (AZ) or across multiple Availability Zones (AZ). This falls under Horizontal Scaling. Read Replicas in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. You can also place your read replica in a different AWS Region closer to your users for better performance. Read replicas are an example of horizontal scaling of resources. Incorrect options: Add a bigger CPU to a computer - As explained above, this comes under vertical scaling since the bigger resource is being added to a single computer or node. Modify an EC2 instance type from t2.nano to u-12tb1.metal - Enhancing the type of a single Amazon EC2 system is also an example of vertical scaling since the extra capacity is being added to a single instance. Modify a Database instance to higher CPU and RAM - This is also an example of vertical scaling since the focus is on increasing the capacity of a single machine or instance.
