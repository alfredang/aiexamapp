    explanation: 'TOPN is an iterator function that iterates a table (2nd argument). Since iterator functions traverse a table row- by-row, all iterators provide a row context where the expression is evaluated (3rd argument). Reference Link: https://dax.guide/topn/ This question tests your understanding of where you would iterate to get the correct results. If you iterate the Purchase table, you get the top 2 purchases by the company since the Purchase table stores individual purchase details. Option B is incorrect. If you iterate the Supplier table, you get the top 2 suppliers from whom the company sourced its units since the Supplier table stores details of individual suppliers. Option A is also incorrect. Only if you iterate a regions table would you be able to create a table with records only for the top 2 regions by units ordered. Since there is no regions table, you can artificially create one using the VALUES function. Here is how the formula works: 1. The VALUES function returns a single column table of unique Regions. The TOPN function iterates this table. 2. Since the formula invokes the measure [Total Units], the DAX engine automatically wraps the measure with a CALCULATE function. 3. The presence of CALCULATE function in a row context means that context transition is automatic. So, the CALCULATE function adds the row values ([Region] = `Central\') to the filter context and filters the table. 4. The DAX engine evaluates the measure [Total Units] only for rows where ([Region] = `Central\'). It sums the value and returns the final result (119). 5. The above steps 3 & 4 repeat for every region. Finally, TOPN selects two regions with the highest value of units ordered. Reference Link: https://dax.guide/values/ https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/expanded-tables-in-dax/ Option D is the correct choice. The DAX formula in option C is incorrect, as the TOPN function and all iterators expect a table/virtual table. They cannot iterate an individual column.

Per the question, we need to display the No of days the bulk orders are received from each City and Sales Channel. So, we need to group by both the columns City and Sales Channel. But, a Basic Group by groups by just one column. So, the option Create a Basic Group by transform. And set the Group by operation to Count Distinct Rows is incorrect. In case you need to add multiple columns to the group, or add multiple columns for aggregation, select \'Advanced.\' Here, we: 1. Grouped by two columns City and Sales Channel. 2. Added a new column No of days bulk orders received 3. Specify the Group by operation as Count Distinct Rows (For each City and Sales Channel combination, Count Distinct Rows increments a count only if the entire row is unique). Since Count Distinct Rows counts rows only if the Order Date is unique (within a City and a Sales Channel combination), it displays the No of days the bulk orders are received from each City and Sales channel. Option Create an Advanced Group by transform. And set the Group by operation to Count Distinct Rows is the correct answer. Option Create an Advanced Group by transform. And set the Group by operation to Count Rows is incorrect. Count Rows counts the number of bulk orders received for each Sales Channel and City. If there were multiple bulk orders on the same day, Count Rows would count each one of them. In the above example, for `Delhi\' and `Direct-to- Consumer\' Sales Channel, Count Rows would have displayed 7. Option Create an Advanced Group by transform.

The proliferation of datasets in the workspace. Since all the users connect to the same data mart, and since there is a good overlap of measures, there is a duplication of datasets in the workspace. To overcome this, we can build and publish a base model (with all the necessary financial calculations) as a Power BI dataset. Instead of directly connecting to the data mart, business users can connect to this dataset to use the existing calculations and build new measures and publish their customized reports. Using a shared dataset ensures that there is only a single financial dataset but different reports to solve various reporting needs, thereby cleaning up the redundant datasets. Option B is the correct choice. Reference Link: https://radacad.com/power-bi-shared-datasets-what-is-it-how-does-it- work-and-why-should-you-care Option D is incorrect.

So, you can convert the calculated column to an equivalent measure by copy-pasting the formula in a measure. Reference Link: https://dax.guide/relatedtable/ Option A is incorrect. While iterating the Product Category table (in row context), the given RELATEDTABLE function returns a table with related rows from the Product table using context transition. Rewriting the calculated column using CALCULATE means we use CALCULATE in the row context, as a row context is available in a calculated column. The presence of CALCULATE in row context means that context transition is automatic. That is, row values (example: Product Category ID from the Product Category table) apply as column filters in the Product table. So, we get the same behavior and output. Option D is also incorrect. In Power Query, you can use the merge operation to combine queries based on the column Product Category ID. Then you can aggregate (average) only the Product Rating column from the Product table. Redesigning the model this way adds a new column Average of Product Rating in the Product Category table. We can use the above column Average of Product Rating for analysis without creating any calculated column/ measure. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/merge-queries-overview Option B is also incorrect. Using the LOOKUPVALUE function is incorrect due to two reasons: 1. First, LOOKUPVALUE can return only a single Product Rating value from the Product table. Since it cannot return multiple values, we cannot calculate the aggregation (average). Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/lookupvalue-function-dax#return-value (last point) 2. You still cannot use LOOKUPVALUE in a calculated column in DirectQuery mode. So, using this solution defeats the entire purpose. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en- us/dax/lookupvalue-function-dax#remarks (last point) [ONLY FOR ADVANCED LEARNERS]: Note to Point 1 above for LOOKUPVALUE 1. Although we get an error, we can still make the LOOKUPVALUE function work by using the function\'s last parameter <alternateResult> to specify a CALCULATE function, in case the function returns an error. We get similar results. But I am sure you would agree that this is not an elegant solution. Rather than using LOOKUPVALUE, we can just use the CALCULATE function. PBIX File Link: '

Or, just customizing any of the built-in themes (even the Default or the Classic) You would see the Tile Theming section when you pin the tiles from the report to a dashboard. Since the question states that you apply a custom theme to your reports by importing a JSON file (point 2 above), the Power BI service will show you the Tile Theming section to help you choose either the current report theme or the destination dashboard theme. So, option A Tile Theming section allows you to choose a theme is the correct answer. Since the reports use a customized theme, Power BI doesn\'t apply any of the source/destination themes directly. So, options The tile uses the current report theme, and The tile uses the destination (dashboard) theme are incorrect. Option The tile uses the default theme of the app workspace is incorrect. There is no default theme setting at the workspace level.

Once the bookmark is created, we set the button\'s Action Type as Bookmark and select the bookmark we created. When the user clicks the button, he navigates to the detailed page (bookmark view shown above). That means, irrespective of the filters the user applies while interacting with the reports, for example, Year (slicer) and Organization Name (column chart), the button (with Action Type bookmark) always produces a static view of the detailed page. Per the question, we need to show the detailed chart only for the selected Year and Organization Name. So, setting the Action Type of the button as Bookmark will not meet the given requirement. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-bookmarks Option A is incorrect. Setting the Action Type of the button as Page navigation helps you to navigate between different report pages. As with bookmarks, Page navigation ignores any filters the user selects.

The drillthrough feature allows the user to right-click the data point (in the column chart) and drill through to the detailed pages. But in our case, we have two additional requirements: 1. The users should be able to drillthrough via the button, not by directly right-clicking the data point. 2. In addition to the filter from the data point on the column chart, we need to pass the Year (from the slicer) to filter the detailed page.

Of all the options, either a KPI visual or a Radial gauge help us track KPI metrics. So, options B and D are incorrect. There are two reasons why a KPI visual is more suitable than a radial gauge. 1. KPI visuals have a trend/time component, whereas a radial gauge does not. Since the finance professional needs to track how the DSO changes over time, a KPI visual is more suitable. 2. The goal of the organization is to reduce the DSO number. A radial gauge only indicates whether the metric is above/below the target.

    explanation: 'Option A talks about using the context menu to switch from the date hierarchy to the date column. Switching from the date hierarchy to the date column breaks the visual. Since Sales Amount MTD is a time-intelligent quick measure, you either need a Power BI-provided date hierarchy or a primary date column to create them. So, you can only use either the Power BI-provided date hierarchy or primary date column to group/filter the quick measure. Switching from the date hierarchy to the date column (Order Date) will no longer use the Power BI-provided date hierarchy. This explains the above error. So, using the context menu to switch from the date hierarchy to the date column will break the visual. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-auto-date-time#work-with-auto- datetime Option A is incorrect. For each date column in the model, Power BI creates a date table (and a hierarchy) to support time intelligence reporting, if the auto date/time option is turned on. We can turn off auto date/time by navigating to File -> Options and Settings -> Options. In the Options window, select Data Load under CURRENT FILE. Disable Auto date/time. But doing so, breaks the visual because quick measures use column variations when used over an automatic Date table. The [Date] in \'Customer Orders\'[Order Date].[Date] refers to the date column of the automatic date table created for Order Date. You can view this [Date] column (hidden in Power BI) when you connect to your Power BI model with DAX Studio. When you turn off the auto date/time option, Power BI deletes the automatic Date table. Consequently, the visual breaks because it doesn\'t know what [Date] refers to. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-auto-date- time#configure-auto-datetime-option https://www.daxpatterns.com/standard-time-related-calculations/#disabling-the-auto-date/time Option B is an incorrect answer. Slicing the quick measure using the date column from the Date table will not work as the quick measure uses Order Date from the Customer Orders table. So, we can slice the quick measure by only the Order Date. Below is the output. Option C is incorrect. The only way to achieve the desired result is to create the quick measure using the date column in the Date table. And then slice the quick measure by the same date column.
