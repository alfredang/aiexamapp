Joins must be defined between physical tables up front, before analysis, and can\'t be changed without impacting all sheets using that data source. Joined tables are always merged into a single table. As a result, sometimes joined data is missing unmatched values, or duplicates aggregated values. Joins - 1) Are displayed with Venn diagram icons between physical tables 2) Require you to select join types and join clauses 3) Joined physical tables are merged into a single logical table with a fixed combination of data 4) May drop unmatched measure values 5) May duplicate aggregate values when fields are at different levels of detail 6) Support scenarios that require a single table of data, such as extract filters and aggregation Reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en- us/datasource_relationships_learnmorepage.htm'

    explanation: 'Tableau displays data source connections and data fields for the workbook in the Data pane on the left side of the workspace. The Data pane includes: Dimension fields � Fields that contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data). You can use dimensions to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data. Dimensions affect the level of detail in the view. Examples of dimensions include dates, customer names, and customer segments. Measure fields � Fields that contain numeric, quantitative values can be measured. You can apply calculations to them and aggregate them. When you drag a measure into the view, Tableau applies an aggregation to that measure (by default). Examples of measures: sales, profit, number of employees, temperature, frequency. For more information on what dimensions and measures are, see Dimensions and Measures, Blue and Green. Calculated fields � If your underlying data doesn\'t include all of the fields you need to answer your questions, you can create new fields in Tableau using calculations and then save them as part of your data source. These fields are called calculated fields. For more information on calculated fields, see Create Custom Fields with Calculations. Sets � Subsets of data that you define. Sets are custom fields based on existing dimensions and criteria that you specify. For more information, see Create Sets. Named sets from an MS Analysis Services server or from a Teradata OLAP connector also appear in Tableau in this area of the Data pane. You can interact with these named sets in the same way you interact with other custom sets in Tableau. Parameters � Values that can be used as placeholders in formulas, or replace constant values in calculated fields and filters. For more information, see Create Parameters.

To create an alias: 1) In the Data pane, right-click a dimension and select Aliases. 2) In the Edit Aliases dialog box, under Value (Alias), select a member and enter a new name. 3) To submit your changes: In Tableau Desktop, click OK. On Tableau Server or Tableau Online, click the X icon in the top-right corner of the dialog box. When you add the field to the view, the alias names appear as labels in the view.
