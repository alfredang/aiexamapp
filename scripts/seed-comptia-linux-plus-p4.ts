This file contains various settings that control the behavior of the SSH server. When a client makes an SSH connection to a server, it\'s the SSH daemon on the server that handles this connection. The daemon listens for incoming connections, authenticates them, and spawns new shells or executes commands as requested by the client.

In the context of the question, if you want to change the port that the SSH server listens on to 2222, you would need to modify the Port directive in the sshd_config file.
