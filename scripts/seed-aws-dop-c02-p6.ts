EventBridge routes that data to targets such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Simple Notification Service. Events are composed of rules. A rule is configured by choosing the following: Event Pattern. Each rule is expressed as an event pattern with the source and type of events to monitor, and event targets. To monitor events, you create a rule with the service you are monitoring as the event source, such as CodePipeline. For example, you can create a rule with an event pattern that that uses CodePipeline as an event source to trigger the rule when there are changes in the state of a pipeline, stage, or action. Targets. The new rule receives a selected service as the event target. You might want to set up a target service to send notifications, capture state information, take corrective action, initiate events, or take other actions. When you add your target, you must also grant permissions to Amazon CloudWatch Events to allow it to invoke the selected target service. For approval actions, the FAILED state means the action was either rejected by the reviewer or failed due to an incorrect action configuration. CORRECT: "All rejected or failed approval actions across all the pipelines" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Failed stage execution events for the executed stage" is incorrect. The specified pattern applies to a CodePipeline Action Execution State Change rather than a CodePipeline Stage Execution State Change. INCORRECT: "Failed deploy and build actions across all the pipelines" is incorrect. The specified pattern applies to rejected or failed approval actions only.

To attach a load balancer you must create a service and you can define the desired count of ECS tasks to run. The database tier of the application can be deployed on a highly available Amazon RDS database that has a multi-AZ replica. This provides fault tolerance across multiple AZs. CORRECT: "Migrate the web tier to an AWS Fargate cluster and configure a service and attach an Application Load Balancer" is a correct answer (as explained above.) CORRECT: "Migrate the MySQL database to an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment" is also a correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Migrate the web tier to an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances across multiple AZs and use an Application Load Balancer" is incorrect. EC2 is not the most cost-effective platform for this solution as the application is already containerized and therefore should run on Amazon ECS for best performance and cost efficiency. INCORRECT: "Migrate the MySQL database to an Amazon RDS instance with a Read Replica in another AZ" is incorrect. A Read replica in another AZ can be used as an asynchronous backup target but the promotion time can be quite long in a failure scenario. A multi-AZ instance allows fast failover. INCORRECT: "Migrate the MySQL database to an Amazon DynamoDB with Global Tables" is incorrect. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, so it is not suitable for migrating MySQL which is a relational database.

Using layers, the various components of the three-tier application can be deployed, updated, and managed. OpsWorks can handle deployment of all resources including application code. Lifecycle events can be used to manage updates to application code and changes to infrastructure. The diagram below depicts an OpsWorks stack that includes three layers representing each tier of the application: CORRECT: "Use AWS OpsWorks to create an Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling group, and application and database resources.

INCORRECT: "Use AWS OpsWorks to create an Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling group, and application resources. Use AWS CloudFormation to create the database resources. Deploy application updates using CloudFormation rolling updates" is incorrect. As with the previous answer, it is better to use OpsWorks to manage the stack. Also, CloudFormation is well suited to deploying infrastructure but is not as good at deploying application code.

    explanation: 'AWS Secrets manager is the preferred option to store database credentials rather than the application code base since Secrets Manager gives many options to manage, rotate and retrieve secrets out of the box. This is more secure as this information is not embedded in the application code. CORRECT: "When secret rotation is configured in Secrets Manager, it causes the secret to rotate once as soon as you store the secret. This can lead to a situation where the old credentials are not usable anymore after the initial rotation.

INCORRECT: "The DB credentials and connection details in Secrets Manager have been encrypted using the default Secrets Manager CMK for the account. The application and secret are in different AWS accounts though, and no cross-account access has been granted" is incorrect. As the account is the same and it is a subsequent deployment post initial version, this is unlikely to be the correct explanation.

    explanation: 'By default health checks are configured to use the HTTP protocol and port 80. For an ALB the traffic protocol must be HTTP or HTTPS, but the port can be customized. The most likely cause of the issue is that the web service is running on the instances and the default protocol/port is used for health checks on the ALB and ASG. This will result in instances becoming "healthy" despite the actual application service not functioning correctly. The engineer should check the ASG health check configuration and the target group health check configuration. If the default values are used then the correct custom port number should be entered instead. The path may also be updated if a specific web page should be checked. The image below shows how you can override the default port number and path in a target group health check: CORRECT: "Modify the Target Group health check configuration to check the application process on the custom port and path" is a correct answer (as explained above.) CORRECT: "Modify the Auto Scaling group health check configuration to check the application process on the custom port and path" is also a correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Inspect the listener configuration on the ALB and check it is configured with the TCP protocol and the custom port" is incorrect. You cannot use a TCP listener with an ALB. It must be HTTP or HTTPS though a custom port number can certainly be used. INCORRECT: "Modify the Target Group configuration to specify targets by IP rather than instance ID to allow routing to any private IP address" is incorrect. The issue is not related to the IP addresses traffic is being directed to on the instances; it is related to the port number and path the health checks are configured to check. INCORRECT: "Create a path-based routing rule to direct traffic to the custom port and path on the EC2 instances" is incorrect. Path-based routing rules are used to route traffic to different target groups based on the path in the HTTP request. In this case there is only one target group, so a path-based routing rule is useless. Instead, the ALB must direct traffic to a custom port number (configured in the listener) and validate the application is healthy be running health checks against the appropriate port and path.
