    explanation: 'Amazon Data Firehose is the fully managed, near-real-time delivery service designed exactly for buffered S3/Redshift/OpenSearch loading with optional Lambda transforms — no shards to manage, pay-per-volume. Kinesis Data Streams gives finer per-record control but requires shard management and a separate consumer to land data. SQS is a queue, not a stream-to-store. MSK is more operationally heavy for this batched-delivery use case.',

    explanation: 'Enhanced fan-out lets you register up to 20 consumers per stream, each with its own dedicated 2 MB/s per shard outbound throughput — solving the "noisy neighbour" problem of standard consumers sharing 2 MB/s/shard.
