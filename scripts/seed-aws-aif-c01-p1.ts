    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Labeled data is annotated with output labels that provide specific information about each data point and is used for supervised learning, whereas, unlabeled data lacks such annotations and is used for unsupervised learning Labeled data is data that comes with predefined labels or annotations. Each data point has an associated label that provides information about the data. This type of data is crucial for supervised learning, where the model learns to predict the output from the input data. Examples: Image classification: Images labeled with the objects they contain. Sentiment analysis: Text labeled with the sentiment it expresses (e.g., positive, negative). Spam detection: Emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam." Unlabeled data is data that does not come with any labels, annotations, or explicit instructions about what it represents. This type of data is often used in unsupervised learning, where the model attempts to find patterns or structures in the data without predefined labels. Examples: Clustering: Grouping similar data points, such as customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information, such as using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Incorrect options: Labeled data consists of raw information with no tags or annotations, while unlabeled data includes tags that provide meaning to the data - Labeled data includes annotations (labels) that provide information about each data point, while unlabeled data does not have these tags. Labeled data can only be used for unsupervised learning algorithms, whereas, unlabeled data is exclusively for supervised learning algorithms - Labeled data is used for supervised learning, where the model learns from the labeled examples, while unlabeled data is used in unsupervised learning to find inherent structures without predefined labels. Labeled data is inherently more complex to process due to the lack of structure, whereas unlabeled data is easier to handle because it has clear annotations - Labeled data is easier to process for specific tasks because of the provided annotations, while unlabeled data requires algorithms to identify patterns without any predefined labels.

    explanation: 'Correct options: Supervised learning algorithms train on sample data that specifies both the algorithm\'s input and output. For example, the data could be images of handwritten numbers that are annotated to indicate which numbers they represent. Given sufficient labeled data, the supervised learning system would eventually recognize the clusters of pixels and shapes associated with each handwritten number. via - https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-machine-learning-supervised-and- unsupervised/ Linear regression Linear regression refers to supervised learning models that, based on one or more inputs, predict a value from a continuous scale. An example of linear regression is predicting a house price. You could predict a house\'s price based on its location, age, and number of rooms after you train a model on a set of historical sales training data with those variables. Neural network A neural network solution is a more complex supervised learning technique. To produce a given outcome, it takes some given inputs and performs one or more layers of mathematical transformation based on adjusting data weightings. An example of a neural network technique is predicting a digit from a handwritten image. Incorrect options: Document classification - This is an example of semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning is when you apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to a common problem. This technique relies on using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train systems. When applying categories to a large document base, there may be too many documents to physically label. For example, these could be countless reports, transcripts, or specifications. Training on the unlabeled data helps identify similar documents for labeling. Association rule learning - This is an example of unsupervised learning. Association rule learning techniques uncover rule-based relationships between inputs in a dataset. For example, the Apriori algorithm conducts market basket analysis to identify rules like coffee and milk often being purchased together. Clustering - Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups certain data inputs, so they may be categorized as a whole. There are various types of clustering algorithms depending on the input data. An example of clustering is identifying different types of network traffic to predict potential security incidents.

      { id: 'D', text: 'Transformer models work by learning a compact representation of data called latent space' }
    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Transformer models use a self-attention mechanism and implement contextual embeddings Transformer models are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data, such as language, in an efficient and scalable way. They rely on a mechanism called self-attention to process input data, allowing them to understand and generate language effectively. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding a particular word. This helps the model capture relationships and dependencies between words, regardless of their position in the sequence. Transformer models use self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, allowing them to capture complex dependencies. Positional encodings provide information about word order, and the encoder-decoder architecture enables effective processing and generation of sequences. This makes transformers highly effective for tasks like language translation, text generation, and more. via - https://aws.amazon.com/what- is/generative-ai/ Incorrect options: Transformer models work by training two neural networks in a competitive manner - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) work by training two neural networks in a competitive manner. The first network, known as the generator, generates fake data samples by adding random noise. The second network, called the discriminator, tries to distinguish between real data and the fake data produced by the generator. Transformer models work by learning a compact representation of data called latent space - Variational autoencoders (VAEs) learn a compact representation of data called latent space. You can think of it as a unique code representing the data based on all its attributes. VAEs use two neural networks--the encoder and the decoder. The encoder neural network maps the input data to a mean and variance for each dimension of the latent space. The decoder neural network takes this sampled point from the latent space and reconstructs it back into data that resembles the original input. Transformer models create new data by iteratively making controlled random changes to an initial data sample - Diffusion models work by first corrupting data with noise through a forward diffusion process and then learning to reverse this process to denoise the data. They use neural networks to predict and remove the noise step by step, ultimately generating new, structured data from random noise. Refere'

For example, OpenAI\'s generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models are LLMs. LLMs are specifically focused on language-based tasks such as such as summarization, text generation, classification, open- ended conversation, and information extraction. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization\'s internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts. Depending on the configuration, Amazon Q Business web application workflow can use LLM/RAG or both. via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/how-it- works.html Incorrect options: Diffusion Model - Diffusion models create new data by iteratively making controlled random changes to an initial data sample. They start with the original data and add subtle changes (noise), progressively making it less similar to the original. This noise is carefully controlled to ensure the generated data remains coherent and realistic. After adding noise over several iterations, the diffusion model reverses the process. Reverse denoising gradually removes the noise to produce a new data sample that resembles the original. Generative adversarial network (GAN) - GANs work by training two neural networks in a competitive manner. The first network, known as the generator, generates fake data samples by adding random noise. The second network, called the discriminator, tries to distinguish between real data and the fake data produced by the generator. During training, the generator continually improves its ability to create realistic data while the discriminator becomes better at telling real from fake. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that is so convincing that the discriminator can\'t differentiate it from real data. Variational a'

Generally, an FM uses learned patterns and relationships to predict the next item in a sequence. For example, with image generation, the model analyzes the image and creates a sharper, more clearly defined version of the image. Similarly, with text, the model predicts the next word in a string of text based on the previous words and their context. It then selects the next word using probability distribution techniques.

So, this option is incorrect. Generative AI ensures 100% security against all cyber threats - While generative AI can improve security by identifying patterns and anomalies, it does not guarantee 100% security against all cyber threats. Security in the cloud involves a combination of multiple strategies and tools. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Generative AI can perform all cloud maintenance tasks without any human intervention - Generative AI can assist in cloud maintenance tasks by predicting issues and suggesting solutions, but it cannot perform all maintenance tasks without human oversight and intervention.
