    explanation: 'A. Correct. "With increased automation... The impact on service desks is reduced phone contact, less low-level work, and a greater ability to focus on excellent CX when personal contact is needed". Ref 5.2.14 B. Incorrect. The effect of automation is to increase self-service, not to decrease it. "With increased automation, AI, robotic process automation (RPA), and chatbots, service desks are moving to provide more self-service logging and resolution directly via online portals and mobile applications". Ref 5.2.14 C. Incorrect. The opposite is true. "With increased automation and the gradual removal of technical debt, the focus of the service desk is to provide support for `people and business\' rather than simply technical issues". Ref 5.2.14 D. Incorrect. The use of automation will not eliminate the need to escalate incidents. "A key point to be understood is that, no matter how efficient the service desk and its people are, there will always be issues that need escalation and underpinning support from other teams".

"Accurate data, carefully analyzed and understood, is the foundation of fact-based decision-making for improvement." The \'continual improvement\' practice should be supported by relevant data sources and by skilled data analytics to ensure that each potential improvement situation is sufficiently understood. Ref 5.1.2 C. Incorrect. A balanced scorecard is one input to making a decision, but on its own it does not serve as the foundation for fact-based decisions. Ref 5.1.2 D. Incorrect. Maturity assessments are useful but they provide only one piece of information, as opposed to providing the foundations for decision-making in the continual improvement practice. Ref 5.1.2'

    explanation: 'A. Incorrect. Demand is the input to the service value chain. Value chain activities "represent the steps an organization takes in the creation of value. Each activity contributes to the value chain by transforming specific inputs into outputs." Ref 4.5 B. Correct. "To convert inputs into outputs, the value chain activities use different combinations of ITIL practices." Ref 4.5 C. Incorrect. It uses various resources from different practices when needed. "To convert inputs into outputs, the value chain activities use different combinations of ITIL practices (sets of resources for performing certain types of work), drawing on internal or third-party resources, processes, skills, and competencies as required." Ref 4.5 D. Incorrect. The \'optimize and automate\' guiding principle recommends that activities should be automated where this is practical but the service value chain does not require automation. "Technology should not always be relied upon without the capability of human intervention, as automation for automation\'s sake can increase costs and reduce organizational robustness and resilience."

(1) (4) "Customer engagement: This involves initial listening, discovery, and information capture on which to base metrics, measurement, and ongoing progress discussions." Ref 5.2.15 A, B, C. Incorrect. (2) Service level management "ensures the organization meets the defined service levels through the collection, analysis, storage, and reporting of the relevant metrics for the identified services," not just through customer engagement. Ref 5.2.15 (3) It may define the requirements for service requests but defining the workflow is part of `service request management\'.

This includes agreeing the overall vision and objectives of the organization." Ref 4.3.7.1 C. Incorrect. This is step 2 of the principle \'optimize and automate\': "Assess the current state of the proposed optimization.

    explanation: 'A. Incorrect. "Normal changes: These are changes that need to be scheduled, assessed, and authorized". This is supported by the `change enablement\' practice, not by \'service request management\'. Ref 5.2.4 B. Incorrect. "As far as possible, emergency changes should be subject to the same testing, assessment, and authorization as normal changes." This is supported by the `change enablement\' practice, not by \'service request management\'. Ref 5.2.4 C. Correct. "Fulfilment of service requests may include changes to services or their components; usually these are standard changes." and "Standard changes: These are low-risk, pre-authorized changes that are well understood and fully documented, and can be implemented without needing additional authorization. They are often initiated as service requests". Ref 5.2.16, 5.2.4 D. Incorrect. "The scope of change enablement is defined by each organization. It will typically include all IT infrastructure, applications, documentation, processes". Some application changes may be managed as standard changes, but others will be normal or emergency changes and will be supported by the \'change enablement\' practice. Ref 5.2.4'

Incorrect. \'Focus on value\' states that all improvement work should deliver measurable value for customers and other stakeholders, but it does not specifically highlight the need to understand the flow of work, identify bottlenecks, and uncover waste. Ref 4.3.1 B. Correct. `Collaborate and promote\' visibility states "Insufficient visibility of work leads to poor decision-making, which in turn impacts the organization\'s ability to improve internal capabilities. It will then become difficult to drive improvements as it will not be clear which ones are likely to have the greatest positive impact on results. To avoid this, the organization needs to perform such critical analysis activities as: understanding the flow of work in progress; identifying bottlenecks, as well as excess capacity; and uncovering waste". Ref 4.3.4.3 C. Incorrect. \'Think and work holistically\' states that the organization should work in an integrated way on the whole, not just on the parts, but it does not specifically highlight the need to understand the flow of work, identify bottlenecks, and uncover waste. Ref 4.3.5 D. Incorrect. \'Keep it simple and practical\' states that the organization should use the minimum number of steps, and eliminate steps that produce no useful outcome. This does imply that you should uncover waste, but it does not specifically highlight the need to understand the flow of work and identify bottlenecks. Ref 4.3.6'

    explanation: 'A. Incorrect. There would not be fewer metrics gathered, although it would combine and aggregate them to provide clearer information. "The practice requires pragmatic focus on the whole service and not simply its constituent parts; for example, simple individual metrics (such as percentage system availability) should not be taken to represent the whole service." Ref 5.2.15 B. Incorrect. The reason is to reduce reporting of the individual system- based metrics which are not meaningful to the customer. "They should relate to defined outcomes and not simply operational metrics. This can be achieved with balanced bundles of metrics." Ref 5.2.15.1 C. Correct. "They should relate to defined outcomes and not simply operational metrics. This can be achieved with balanced bundles of metrics." Ref 5.2.15.1 D. Incorrect. This does not affect the mechanism for metric collection.

"Organizations must maximize the value of the work carried out by their human and technical resources." Ref 4.3.7 C. Incorrect. This shows how to approach making changes. "Resist the temptation to do everything at once. Even huge initiatives must be accomplished iteratively. By organizing work into smaller, manageable sections that can be executed and completed in a timely manner, the focus on each effort will be sharper and easier to maintain." Ref 4.3.3 D. Correct.

The guiding principle \'focus on value\' advises "All activities conducted by the organization should link back, directly or indirectly, to value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders." This is not the main concern of the guiding principle \'start where you are\'. Ref 4.3.1 B. Correct. The guiding principle \'start where you are\' advises "Having a proper understanding of the current state of services and methods is important to selecting which elements to re-use, alter, or build upon." Ref 4.3.2.3 C. Incorrect. The focus of the guiding principle \'collaborate and promote visibility\' is on involving the right stakeholders and communicating with them. "When initiatives involve the right people in the correct roles, efforts benefit from better buy-in, more relevance (because better information is available for decision-making) and increased likelihood of long-term success". This is not the main concern of the guiding principle \'start where you are\'. Ref 4.3.4 D. Incorrect. The main concern of the guiding principle \'progress iteratively with feedback\' is breaking initiatives into smaller parts.
