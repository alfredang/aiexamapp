Acceptable use agreements also establish requirements for the removal of personal data, especially when privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA apply to the data. This is done to reduce the risk of the data being identified. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is an acceptable use agreement that establishes the rules of engagement between two parties and defines roles and expectations. MOUs are non-binding and are difficult to enforce because they are not formal contracts. A data use agreement is any document that addresses the use and exchange or sharing of information. These agreements are normally legally binding and include contracts, non- disclosure agreements, memorandums of understanding, and other legal instruments. A non- disclosure agreement (NDA) defines the conditions under which an entity (such as a person or supplier) cannot disclose information to parties outside of the agreement.

An r value is the correlation coefficient. An r value that is close to 1 indicates that there is a strong correlation between dependent and independent variables, while an R-value of or close to 0 means there is no correlation.

When consumers can leverage dashboards, or run their own reports from the systems the organization has purchased, they are doing self-service. Root cause analysis attempts to identify the cause of a problem that has occurred and can be a useful component of research- driven reports that seek to improve business processes. A tactical dashboard is centered on the operational details of a process or operation. These dashboards can monitor strategic business initiatives that cover long periods of time and must be monitored and measured to be effective.

Each bin is placed on the x-axis with the y-axis holding the assessed value. A line graph, or run chart, uses a single horizontal line or a group of multiple lines to represent different data points at different times. This is typically used when an analyst wants to display time-series data, or data over intervals of time because the connected line makes it easier to see how that data changes over time.

KPIs can be used to monitor the status of products, processes, or sales goals for example. Scope creep is the adjustment of the outline of a project and its measurable tasks that are needed to meet the desired end state. These adjustments can cause issues in meeting deadlines or cause a gap in reaching the desired state on time and within budget. Simple linear regression is used to study the relationship between one dependent variable and one predictor, or independent variable. This analysis informs an analyst on which predictor may have the largest impact. Regression analysis is a statistical method used to estimate relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.'

Distributed processing takes large-volume data sets and distributes them across multiple servers.

A scatter plot consists of two variables plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, with a dot placed on the graph where the two data points converge on both of the axes. Scatter plots help analysts determine if there is a relationship between the two variables placed on the axes, and are especially useful to spot outliers in a data set. A histogram is similar to a column chart but has the ability to show the frequency of values that are grouped by bins, or class intervals. Each bin is placed on the x-axis with the y-axis holding the assessed value. A line graph, or run chart, uses a single horizontal line or a group of multiple lines to represent different data points at different times. This is typically used when an analyst wants to display time-series data, or data over intervals of time because the connected line makes it easier to see how that data changes over time.'
