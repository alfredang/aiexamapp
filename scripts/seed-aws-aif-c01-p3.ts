    explanation: 'Correct option: Machine learning involves training algorithms on large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on new data Machine learning works by training algorithms on large datasets, allowing them to identify patterns within the data. Once trained, these algorithms can make predictions or decisions when presented with new data, improving their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. The central idea behind machine learning is an existing mathematical relationship between any input and output data combination. The machine learning model does not know this relationship in advance but can guess if sufficient examples of input-output data sets are given. This means every machine learning algorithm is built around a modifiable math function. The underlying principle can be understood like this: We `train\' the algorithm by giving it the following input/output (i,o) combinations � (2,10), (5,19), and (9,31) The algorithm computes the relationship between input and output to be: o=3*i+4 We then give it input 7 and ask it to predict the output. It can automatically determine the output as 25. While this is a basic understanding, machine learning focuses on the principle that computer systems can mathematically link all complex data points as long as they have sufficient data and computing power to process. Therefore, the accuracy of the output is directly co-relational to the magnitude of the input given. Machine learning phases are given below. via - https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/ Incorrect options: Machine learning works by using predefined rules to generate outcomes without the need for data input - Machine learning does not rely on predefined rules alone; it uses data to learn and make predictions or decisions.

    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Yes, it is possible to increase both bias and variance, but this typically leads to a model that performs poorly due to both underfitting and overfitting Bias is an error introduced by approximating a real-world problem (which may be complex) by a simpler model. High bias can cause the model to miss relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting). Variance is an error introduced by the model\'s sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance can cause the model to mimic the random noise in the training data rather than the intended outputs (overfitting). It is possible to increase both bias and variance, but doing so usually results in a model that is both underfit and overfit, leading to poor performance. High bias causes the model to miss important patterns (underfitting), while high variance makes the model too sensitive to noise in the training data (overfitting). For example, if you reduce the amount of training data, the model has less information to learn from. This can increase bias because the model may not capture the underlying patterns well (underfitting). At the same time, with less data, the model can become more sensitive to fluctuations in the training data, increasing variance. Incorrect options: Yes, increasing both bias and variance simultaneously will improve the model\'s accuracy and generalization capabilities - Increasing both bias and variance will not improve the model\'s performance. High bias can lead to underfitting, and high variance can lead to overfitting, making the model perform poorly. No, it is not possible to increase both bias and variance simultaneously, as they are inversely related - Bias and variance are not inversely related to the extent that one cannot increase both. It is possible to design a model that suffers from both high bias and high variance. No, increasing bias always decreases variance and vice versa, so they cannot be increased at the same time - While there is often a trade-off between bias and variance, they can both be high in a poorly designed model.

Real-time inference follows a synchronous execution mode, whereas batch inference follows an asynchronous execution mode Synchronous execution means that a request is made, and the process waits for the response before proceeding. The client (e.g., a user, application, or service) sends a request to the inference system and waits for the prediction result to be returned immediately. The execution of the task is completed in a single, continuous operation. Asynchronous execution means that the request and the response are handled independently. The client sends a request to the inference system, which processes the request at its own pace and returns the results at a later time. The execution of the task is decoupled from the initial request, allowing the client to continue with other tasks. Summary of Key Differences Real-time inference (synchronous execution) - Interaction: Direct and immediate. Operation: Blocking; the client waits for the result. Use Cases: Applications where immediate feedback is required (e.g., chatbots, real-time recommendations, online fraud detection). Batch inference (asynchronous execution) - Interaction: Indirect and delayed. Operation: Non-blocking; the client can perform other tasks while waiting for the result. Use Cases: Applications where immediate feedback is not necessary, and processing can be done in bulk (e.g., nightly data analysis, periodic reporting, large-scale data processing). via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/batch-inference-at-scale-with-amazon-sagemaker/ Incorrect options: Real-time inference processes data in large batches at scheduled intervals, while batch inference processes individual data points'

Deep learning algorithms analyze data with a logic structure similar to that used by humans. They use artificial neural networks to process information in layers. Semi-supervised Learning - As the name suggests, this method combines supervised and unsupervised learning. The technique relies on using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train systems. First, the labeled data is used to partially train the machine learning algorithm. After that, the partially trained algorithm labels the unlabeled data. This process is called pseudo-labeling. The model is then re-trained on the resulting data mix without being explicitly programmed. Unsupervised Learning - Unsupervised learning algorithms train on unlabeled data. They scan through new data, trying to establish meaningful connections between the inputs and predetermined outputs. They can spot patterns and categorize data. For example, unsupervised algorithms could group news articles from different news sites into common categories like sports, crime, etc. References: https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/faqs/ https://aws.amazon.com/what- is/reinforcement-learning/ https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/'

    ],
    correct: ['D'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Multi-class classification assigns each instance to one of several possible classes, while multi-label classification assigns each instance to one or more classes With multi-label classification, you can train models and classify your documents with more than one label. For example, you can use multi-label classification to categorize customer contact transcripts with one or more labels to identify departments within your company like Payments, Renewals, or Tech Support. These labels can then be mapped to relevant content in your support library or directed towards the appropriate contacts within your company. ML models for multiclass classification problems allow you to generate predictions for multiple classes (predict one of more than two outcomes). Therefore, the key difference is that multi-class classification assigns each instance to one of several possible classes (e.g., an image classified as either a cat, dog, or bird), whereas multi-label classification can assign each instance to multiple classes simultaneously (e.g., a document classified as both "science" and "technology"). Incorrect options: Multi-class classification allows each instance to belong to multiple classes simultaneously, whereas multi-label classification restricts each instance to one class only - Multi-class classification restricts each instance to one class, while multi-label classification allows each instance to belong to multiple classes. So, this option is incorrect. Multi-class classification is used exclusively for image data, whereas multi-label classification is used exclusively for text data - Both multi-class and multi- label classification can be applied to various data types, including images and text. Multi-class classification does not require labeled data, whereas multi-label classification requires labeled data for training - Both types of classification require labeled data for training the models effectively.

They scan through new data and establish meaningful connections between the unknown input and predetermined outputs. For instance, unsupervised learning algorithms could group news articles from different news sites into common categories like sports and crime. Clustering Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups certain data inputs, so they may be categorized as a whole. There are various types of clustering algorithms depending on the input data. An example of clustering is identifying different types of network traffic to predict potential security incidents. Dimensionality reduction Dimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning technique that reduces the number of features in a dataset. It\'s often used to preprocess data for other machine learning functions and reduce complexity and overheads. For example, it may blur out or crop background features in an image recognition application. via - https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-machine-learning- supervised-and-unsupervised/ Incorrect options: Decision tree - The decision tree is a supervised machine learning technique that takes some given inputs and applies an if-else structure to predict an outcome. An example of a decision tree problem is predicting customer churn. Neural network - A neural network solution is a more complex supervised learning technique. To produce a given outcome, it takes some given inputs and performs one or more layers of mathematical transformation based on adjusting data weightings. An example of a neural network technique is predicting a digit from a handwritten image. Sentiment analysis - This is an example of semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning is when you apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to a common problem. This technique relies on using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train systems. When considering the breadth of an organization\'s text-based customer interactions, it may not be cost-effective to categorize or label sentiment across all channels. An organization could train a model on the larger unlabeled portion of data first, and then a sample that has been labeled.

Instead, the model relies on its general understanding and knowledge to provide a response. For example, classifying text into categories (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic detection) without providing specific training examples for those categories. Incorrect options: Negative prompting - Negative prompting refers to guiding a generative AI model to avoid certain outputs or behaviors when generating content. In the context of AWS generative AI, like those using Amazon Bedrock, negative prompting is used to refine and control the output of models by specifying what should not be included in the generated content. For example, when generating text for a marketing campaign, a company can use negative prompts to exclude competitive brand names or sensitive topics.

    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Underfit models experience high bias, whereas, overfit models experience high variance Your model is underfitting the training data when the model performs poorly on the training data. This is because the model is unable to capture the relationship between the input examples (often called X) and the target values (often called Y). Your model is overfitting your training data when you see that the model performs well on the training data but does not perform well on the evaluation data. This is because the model is memorizing the data it has seen and is unable to generalize to unseen examples. Underfit models experience high bias -- they give inaccurate results for both the training data and test set. On the other hand, overfit models experience high variance - they give accurate results for the training set but not for the test set. More model training results in less bias but variance can increase. Data scientists aim to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting when fitting a model.

    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Fine-tuning Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully designing prompts to efficiently tap into the capabilities of FMs. It involves the use of prompts, which are short pieces of text that guide the model to generate more accurate and relevant responses. With prompt engineering, you can improve the performance of FMs and make them more effective for a variety of applications. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows you to customize a model\'s responses when you want the model to consider new knowledge or up-to- date information. When your data changes frequently, like inventory or pricing, it\'s not practical to fine-tune and update the model while it\'s serving user queries. To equip the FM with up-to- date proprietary information, organizations turn to RAG, a technique that involves fetching data from company data sources and enriching the prompt with that data to deliver more relevant and accurate responses. RAG produces quality results, due to augmenting use case-specific context directly from vectorized data stores. Compared to prompt engineering, it produces vastly improved results with massively low chances of hallucinations. RAG has a higher complexity than prompt engineering because you need to have coding and architecture skills to implement this solution. via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/best-practices- to-build-generative-ai-applications-on-aws/ Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained FM, such as Llama 2, and further training it on a downstream task with a dataset specific to that task. The pre-trained model provides general linguistic knowledge, and fine-tuning allows it to specialize and improve performance on a particular task like text classification, question answering, or text generation. With fine-tuning, you provide labeled datasets--which are annotated with additional context--to train the model on specific tasks. Model customization - such as fine-tuning - has higher complexity than prompt engineering and RAG because the model\'s weight and parameters are being changed via tuning scripts, which requires data science and ML expertise. via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/best- practices-to-build-generative-ai-applications-on-aws/ Incorrect options: Prompt engineering, Fine-tuning, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Fine-tuning, Prompt engineering Retrieval Augmented Generat'

Feature selection, on the other hand, involves selecting a subset of the most relevant features from the original dataset, typically using methods like forward selection, backward elimination, or regularization techniques. via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/machine-learning- lens/feature-engineering.html Incorrect options: Feature extraction involves selecting the most relevant features from the dataset, while feature selection involves creating new features from existing data - Feature extraction involves creating new features from existing data by transforming it, whereas feature selection involves selecting the most relevant features from the existing ones. Feature extraction and feature selection are both used to remove irrelevant features but do not reduce the dimensionality of the dataset - Both feature extraction and feature selection are techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Feature extraction is only applicable to supervised learning, while feature selection is only applicable to unsupervised learning - Both feature extraction and feature selection can be applied in supervised and unsupervised learning contexts.
