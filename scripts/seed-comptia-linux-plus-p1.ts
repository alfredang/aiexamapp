This parity information is used to recreate the missing data from a failed storage drive. Disk cloning is the process of creating a bit-by-bit copy of a storage device to another device. Disk cloning is not a feature used by RAIDs. A RAID 0 provides disk striping across at least two storage disks. The disk partitions are divided into sections called stripes and data is written sequentially across the different stripes. A RAID 1 provides disk mirroring by duplicating the data on two different storage disks to provide complete redundancy.
