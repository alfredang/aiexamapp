    correct: ['A', 'E'],
    explanation: 'The key issue here is that some parameters such as passwords may be exposed when deploying infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation. This data could be exposed through the console, command line tools, or API. There are a couple of ways the company can deal with this issue. Firstly, AWS Secrets Manager can be used to store secure encrypted values. These values can be securely used in CloudFormation by referencing them as dynamic references. Another option is to use the NoEcho parameter property to mask sensitive data. If you set the NoEcho attribute to true, CloudFormation returns the parameter value masked as asterisks (*****) for any calls that describe the stack or stack events. CORRECT: "Use AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive data as secret values and use dynamic references in AWS CloudFormation" is a correct answer (as explained above.) CORRECT: "Use the CloudFormation NoEcho parameter property to mask any sensitive parameter values" is also a correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to store sensitive data as secure strings and reference the strings using tags in the CloudFormation template" is incorrect. You cannot securely share secure strings in SSM Parameter Store by using tags in the CloudFormation template. Tags are used for assigning optional metadata. INCORRECT: "Use AWS Secrets Manager to encrypt the CloudFormation template at rest using an AWS KMS key" is incorrect. Secrets Manager cannot be used to encrypt the template and the main issue is not the encryption of the template but preventing exposure of sensitive data during deployment operations. INCORRECT: "Use an Amazon S3 bucket with default encryption enabled to store the AWS CloudFormation template" is incorrect. This ensures the encryption of the template but does not protect sensitive data from being exposed during deployment operations.

    explanation: 'In a hybrid environment the most secure deployment includes using Systems Manager Hybrid activations for on-premises servers and an IAM role for the EC2 instances. The hybrid activations feature in systems manager is a more secure option than using access keys as it uses an IAM service role. To ensure that systems are not affected during business hours the DevOps engineer needs to simply select a patching window during acceptable times and Systems Manager Patch Manager will only apply updates during that timeframe. CORRECT: "Add the on-premises servers into AWS Systems Manager using Systems Manager Hybrid Activations" is a correct answer (as explained above.) CORRECT: "Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instances, granting AWS Systems Manager permission to manage the instances" is also a correct answer (as explained above.) CORRECT: "Use AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows to schedule a patch window outside of business hours" is also a correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Create IAM access keys for the on-premises servers to provide permission to AWS Systems Manager" is incorrect. This is a less secure method than using Hybrid Activations in Systems Manager and would also be harder to manage. INCORRECT: "Create an AWS Systems Manager Automation document that installs that latest patches every hour" is incorrect.

    explanation: 'Geo-proximity Routing - Lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource. The catch in the question is a few regions have heavier traffic load than the others so a bias needs to be configured and geoproximity routing is a better fit for this solution. CORRECT: "Deploy the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer in two different Regions. Create a Route 53 geoproximity-based routing record. Point the record to each of your load balancers" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Deploy the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer in two different Regions. Create a Route 53 geolocation-based routing record. Point the record to each of your load balancers" is incorrect. If the discrepancy between traffic volume was unknown, this would also been a correct option. INCORRECT: "Utilize Route 53 latency-based routing and deploy the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer in two different Regions" is incorrect. Latency-based routing is based on latency measurements performed over a period, and the measurements reflect changes in network connectivity and routing.

    explanation: 'AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define. You can deploy AWS WAF on Amazon CloudFront as part of your CDN solution, the Application Load Balancer that fronts your web servers or origin servers running on EC2, or Amazon API Gateway for your APIs. CORRECT: "Use an AWS WAF IP set statement that specifies the IP addresses that needs to be allowed" is a correct answer (as explained above.) CORRECT: "Use an AWS WAF geo match statement listing the countries that need to be blocked" is also a correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Use an ALB geo match statement listing the countries that needs to be blocked" is incorrect. An ALB cannot block or allow traffic based on geographic match conditions or IP based conditions. INCORRECT: "Use an ALB IP set statement that specifies the IP addresses that needs to be allow through" is incorrect. Geo match restriction works with WAF and not ALB. The correct way to add geo restriction is to bind the condition as an WAF rule. INCORRECT: "Create a deny rule for the blocked countries in the NACL associated with each of the EC2 instances" is incorrect.

A stack set\'s CloudFormation template defines all the resources in each stack. As you create the stack set, specify the template to use, in addition to any parameters and capabilities that template requires. You can create a stack set using the AWS Management Console or using AWS CloudFormation commands in the AWS CLI. You can create a stack set with either self-managed or service-managed permissions. With self-managed permissions, you can deploy stack instances to specific AWS accounts in specific Regions. To do this, you must first create the necessary IAM roles to establish a trusted relationship between the account you\'re administering the stack set from and the account you\'re deploying stack instances to. With service-managed permissions, you can deploy stack instances to accounts managed by AWS Organizations in specific Regions. With this model, you don\'t need to create the necessary IAM roles; StackSets creates the IAM roles on your behalf In this case the best solution is to use self-managed permissions as the partner companies have only granted the ability to create IAM roles.

Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to synchronize changes" is incorrect. The better solution is to use Aurora Global Database as this will simplify the failover process which can be instantiated through a few API calls. Also, this replication uses Aurora replication with low latency and the Aurora reader endpoint can also be utilized in the second Region. INCORRECT: "Create an Amazon Aurora multi-master cluster across multiple Regions for the database tier. Configure the database in an active- active mode across the Regions" is incorrect. It is not possible to create multi-master clusters across Regions, they work within a Region only. INCORRECT: "Deploy the application in two Regions and create Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing records pointing to the ALB in each Regions. Enable health checks for the records" is incorrect. Failover routing policy records should be created, not latency routing records. With latency records users closer to the secondary Region will be directed there but the DB layer is not in read/write mode except in a DR scenario.
