This is to ensure each row is unique and can be addressed by a unique number. A customer name would make a terrible ID field as it might not be unique.

This incoming data typically arrives in an unstructured or semi-structured format, such as JSON, and has the same processing requirements as batch processing, but with shorter turnaround times to support real-time consumption.

Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures. Locally redundant storage (LRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region.

    correct: ['D'],
    explanation: 'Azure Data Lake is the correct answer. Blob Storage is also a place to store data before processing, but if you can\'t estimate how much data, there are limits on the size per account. Cosmos DB is not great for large amounts of unprocessed data. A Data Lake is a much better answer for ingesting data before processing.

    correct: ['D'],
    explanation: 'Paginated reports are great when you need all of the details in one place. Instead of printing thousands of rows on the screen, you paginate them which makes it easier to navigate. It can also be printed. Charts and graphs are more likely to appear on a dashboard, where data needs to be summarized. And I would not suggest creating a report that spans 100,000s of pages because no one will ever read that.
