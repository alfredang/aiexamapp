It does not store live data but is pre-configured with hardware, making it faster to bring online compared to a cold site, which lacks pre-installed equipment. A hot site is more expensive due to its real-time data synchronization, and mobile sites are not a common disaster recovery solution.'

This is crucial in preventing compromised or non-compliant devices from causing security incidents. In contrast, post-admission NAC applies checks after the device has gained access, which poses a greater risk as the device may already be interacting with sensitive systems.'
