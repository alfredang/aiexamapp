As a self-managed team they need to adapt to the situation, adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.

For the answer "It controls whether the Developers have completed their tasks to agreed standards" The key word here is "tasks". The DoD is to ensure the increment meets its quality standards. It is not to ensure individual tasks are done to agreed standards, although it is popular to set task-level acceptance criteria for this, but acceptance criteria is not part of the Scrum Guide.'

If they feel the new features cannot be completed in this sprint the Product Owner should put them in the Product Backlog to consider them for the next Sprint.

The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value." Scrum Guide 2020.
