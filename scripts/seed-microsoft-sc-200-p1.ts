Next Step is to tag your devices. After tagging all devices with "RansomTag," you need to promote your group because the devices already belong to existing groups, as specified in the details. If your group isn\'t promoted to the highest rank, the devices will retain their original group assignments. Finally, Elevate "AllDeviceGroup" to the highest rank. Hence, to summarize, We need to add the tag to the devices, then assign the tag to the device group to create a group based on the tags, and then rank it #1 so it takes precedence over the other groups.
