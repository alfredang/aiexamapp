Using deployment rings, you can onboard a set number of devices at a time, identify potential issues, and resolve them before proceeding to the next set of devices. This approach is helpful for your scenario because you don\'t want to onboard all your devices simultaneously. The first step is to evaluate a relatively small number of test devices (up to 50) to ensure they meet your exit criteria before moving to the next ring. Your exit criteria may include confirming whether the devices are visible on the devices list and whether alerts appear on the dashboard. You can move to the pilot ring if the devices pass the evaluation ring. In this ring, you choose more devices to onboard (between 50 and 100 devices). You can proceed to the next deployment ring if the devices meet your exit criteria. Finally, if the devices pass the pilot ring, you can move to the full deployment ring, where you onboard the rest of your devices in increments. You can access best practice material on doing this using the deployment link in the Learn More section. Exit criteria are already part of the evaluation process, so there is no need to define them separately as a part of the deployment ring structure.'
