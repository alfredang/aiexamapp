    explanation: 'Correct option: AWS CloudFormation template is a JSON- or YAML-formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure. Templates include several major sections. The "Resources" section is the only required section. The optional "Transform" section specifies one or more macros that AWS CloudFormation uses to process your template. Presence of Transform section indicates it is a Serverless Application Model (SAM) template - The AWS::Serverless transform, which is a macro hosted by AWS CloudFormation, takes an entire template written in the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) syntax and transforms and expands it into a compliant AWS CloudFormation template. So, the presence of the Transform section indicates, the document is a SAM template. Incorrect options: It represents a Lambda function definition - Lambda function is created using "AWS::Lambda::Function" resource and has no connection to Transform section. It represents an intrinsic function - Intrinsic Functions in templates are used to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime. They usually start with Fn:: or !.

    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Configure Application Auto Scaling to manage Lambda provisioned concurrency on a schedule Concurrency is the number of requests that a Lambda function is serving at any given time. If a Lambda function is invoked again while a request is still being processed, another instance is allocated, which increases the function\'s concurrency. Due to a spike in traffic, when Lambda functions scale, this causes the portion of requests that are served by new instances to have higher latency than the rest. To enable your function to scale without fluctuations in latency, use provisioned concurrency. By allocating provisioned concurrency before an increase in invocations, you can ensure that all requests are served by initialized instances with very low latency. You can configure Application Auto Scaling to manage provisioned concurrency on a schedule or based on utilization. Use scheduled scaling to increase provisioned concurrency in anticipation of peak traffic. To increase provisioned concurrency automatically as needed, use the Application Auto Scaling API to register a target and create a scaling policy. Please see this note for more details on provisioned concurrency: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration- concurrency.html Incorrect options: Configure Application Auto Scaling to manage Lambda reserved concurrency on a schedule - To ensure that a function can always reach a certain level of concurrency, you can configure the function with reserved concurrency. When a function has reserved concurrency, no other function can use that concurrency. More importantly, reserved concurrency also limits the maximum concurrency for the function, and applies to the function as a whole, including versions and aliases. You cannot configure Application Auto Scaling to manage Lambda reserved concurrency on a schedule. Add an Application Load Balancer in front of the Lambda functions - This is a distractor as just adding the Application Load Balancer will not help in scaling the Lambda functions to address the surge in traffic. No need to make any special provisions as Lambda is automatically scalable because of its serverless nature - It\'s true that Lambda is serverless, however, due to the surge in traffic the Lambda functions can still hit the concurrency limits. So this option is incorrect. Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html'

It makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. AWS CodeCommit helps you collaborate on code with teammates via pull requests, branching and merging. AWS CodeCommit keeps your repositories close to your build, staging, and production environments in the AWS cloud. You can transfer incremental changes instead of the entire application. AWS CodeCommit supports all Git commands and works with your existing Git tools. You can keep using your preferred development environment plugins, continuous integration/continuous delivery systems, and graphical clients with CodeCommit. Incorrect options: Amazon Versioned S3 Bucket - AWS CodeCommit is designed for collaborative software development. It manages batches of changes across multiple files, offers parallel branching, and includes version differencing ("diffing"). In comparison, Amazon S3 versioning supports recovering past versions of individual files but doesn\'t support tracking batched changes that span multiple files or other features needed for collaborative software development. AWS CodePipeline - AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed "continuous delivery" service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. CodePipeline automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process every time there is a code change, based on the release model you define. AWS CodeBuild - AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you don\'t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue.

    explanation: 'Correct option: An outbound rule must be added to the Network ACL (NACL) to allow the response to be sent to the client on the ephemeral port range Security groups are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Network ACLs are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic. By default, each custom Network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules. To enable the connection to a service running on an instance, the associated network ACL must allow both: 1. Inbound traffic on the port that the service is listening on 2. Outbound traffic to ephemeral ports When a client connects to a server, a random port from the ephemeral port range (1024-65535) becomes the client\'s source port. The designated ephemeral port becomes the destination port for return traffic from the service. Outbound traffic to the ephemeral port must be allowed in the network ACL. Incorrect options: The configuration is complete on the EC2 instance for accepting and responding to requests - As explained above, this is an incorrect statement. An outbound rule on the security group has to be configured, to allow the response to be sent to the client on the HTTP port - Security groups are stateful. Therefore you don\'t need a rule that allows responses to inbound traffic. Outbound rules need to be configured both on the security group and on the NACL for sending responses to the Internet Gateway* - Security Groups are stateful.

You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. How Elastic BeanStalk Works: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html The \'Immutable\' deployment policy ensures that your new application version is always deployed to new instances, instead of updating existing instances. It also has the additional advantage of a quick and safe rollback in case the deployment fails. In an immutable update, a second Auto Scaling group is launched in your environment and the new version serves traffic alongside the old version until the new instances pass health checks. In case of deployment failure, the new instances are terminated, so the impact is minimal. Overview of Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Policies: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using- features.deploy-existing-version.html Incorrect options: Deploy the new application version using \'All at once\' deployment policy - Although \'All at once\' is the quickest deployment method, but the application may become unavailable to users (or have low availability) for a short time. Also in case of deployment failure, the application sees a downtime, so this option is not correct. Deploy the new application version using \'Rolling\' deployment policy - This policy avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Use delay queues to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for several seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages. If you create a delay queue, any messages that you send to the queue remain invisible to consumers for the duration of the delay period. The default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes. via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html Incorrect options: Use FIFO queues to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds - SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. You cannot use FIFO queues to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds. Use dead-letter queues to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds - Dead-letter queues can be used by other queues (source queues) as a target for messages that can\'t be processed (consumed) successfully. Dead-letter queues are useful for debugging your application or messaging system because they let you isolate problematic messages to determine why their processing doesn\'t succeed. You cannot use dead-letter queues to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds. Use visibility timeout to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds - Visibility timeout is a period during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing a given message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. You cannot use visibility timeout to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Configure and push high-resolution custom metrics to CloudWatch that record the failures of the external payment processing API calls. Create a CloudWatch alarm that sends a notification via the existing SNS topic when the error rate exceeds the specified rate You can publish your own metrics, known as custom metrics, to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API. Each metric is one of the following: Standard resolution, with data having a one-minute granularity High resolution, with data at a granularity of one second Metrics produced by AWS services are standard resolution by default. When you publish a custom metric, you can define it as either standard resolution or high resolution. When you publish a high-resolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of 1 second, and you can read and retrieve it with a period of 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or any multiple of 60 seconds. High-resolution metrics can give you more immediate insight into your application\'s sub-minute activity. Keep in mind that every PutMetricData call for a custom metric is charged, so calling PutMetricData more often on a high-resolution metric can lead to higher charges. You can create metric and composite alarms in Amazon CloudWatch.

TransactWriteItems is a synchronous and idempotent write operation that groups up to 25 write actions in a single all-or-nothing operation. These actions can target up to 25 distinct items in one or more DynamoDB tables within the same AWS account and in the same Region. The aggregate size of the items in the transaction cannot exceed 4 MB. The actions are completed atomically so that either all of them succeed or none of them succeeds. You can optionally include a client token when you make a TransactWriteItems call to ensure that the request is idempotent. Making your transactions idempotent helps prevent application errors if the same operation is submitted multiple times due to a connection time-out or other connectivity issue. Incorrect options: Use BatchWriteItem API to update multiple tables simultaneously - A TransactWriteItems operation differs from a BatchWriteItem operation in that all the actions it contains must be completed successfully, or no changes are made at all. With a BatchWriteItem operation, it is possible that only some of the actions in the batch succeed while the others do not. Capture the transactions in the players table using DynamoDB streams and then sync with the items table Capture the transactions in the items table using DynamoDB streams and then sync with the players table Many applications benefit from capturing changes to items stored in a DynamoDB table, at the point in time when such changes occur. DynamoDB supports streaming of item-level change data capture records in near-real-time. You can build applications that consume these streams and take action based on the contents. DynamoDB streams cannot be used to capture transactions in DynamoDB, therefore both these options are incorrect.

    correct: ['D'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Redeploy the API to an existing stage or to a new stage After creating your API, you must deploy it to make it callable by your users. To deploy an API, you create an API deployment and associate it with a stage. A stage is a logical reference to a lifecycle state of your API (for example, dev, prod, beta, v2). API stages are identified by the API ID and stage name. Every time you update an API, you must redeploy the API to an existing stage or to a new stage. Updating an API includes modifying routes, methods, integrations, authorizers, and anything else other than stage settings. Incorrect options: Developers need IAM permissions on API execution component of API Gateway - Access control access to Amazon API Gateway APIs is done with IAM permissions. To call a deployed API or to refresh the API caching, you must grant the API caller permissions to perform required IAM actions supported by the API execution component of API Gateway. In the current scenario, developers do not need permissions on "execution components" but on "management components" of API Gateway that help them to create, deploy, and manage an API. Hence, this statement is an incorrect option. Enable Lambda authorizer to access API - A Lambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer) is an API Gateway feature that uses a Lambda function to control access to your API. So, this feature too helps in access control, but in the current scenario its the developers and not the users who are facing the issue. So, this statement is an incorrect option. Use Stage Variables for development state of API - Stage variables are name-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of a REST API. They act like environment variables and can be used in your API setup and mapping templates. Stage variables are not connected to the scenario described in the current use case.

When you encrypt data directly with AWS KMS it must be transferred over the network. Envelope encryption reduces the network load since only the request and delivery of the much smaller data key go over the network. The data key is used locally in your application or encrypting AWS service, avoiding the need to send the entire block of data to AWS KMS and suffer network latency. AWS Lambda environment variables can have a maximum size of 4 KB. Additionally, the direct \'Encrypt\' API of KMS also has an upper limit of 4 KB for the data payload. To encrypt 1 MB, you need to use the Encryption SDK and pack the encrypted file with the lambda function.

    explanation: 'Correct options: When you create a signer, the public key is with CloudFront and private key is used to sign a portion of URL - Each signer that you use to create CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies must have a public�private key pair. The signer uses its private key to sign the URL or cookies, and CloudFront uses the public key to verify the signature. When you create signed URLs or signed cookies, you use the private key from the signer\'s key pair to sign a portion of the URL or the cookie. When someone requests a restricted file, CloudFront compares the signature in the URL or cookie with the unsigned URL or cookie, to verify that it hasn\'t been tampered with. CloudFront also verifies that the URL or cookie is valid, meaning, for example, that the expiration date and time haven\'t passed. When you use the root user to manage CloudFront key pairs, you can only have up to two active CloudFront key pairs per AWS account - When you use the root user to manage CloudFront key pairs, you can only have up to two active CloudFront key pairs per AWS account. Whereas, with CloudFront key groups, you can associate a higher number of public keys with your CloudFront distribution, giving you more flexibility in how you use and manage the public keys. By default, you can associate up to four key groups with a single distribution, and you can have up to five public keys in a key group. Incorrect options: You can also use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions policies to restrict what the root user can do with CloudFront key pairs - When you use the AWS account root user to manage CloudFront key pairs, you can\'t restrict what the root user can do or the conditions in which it can do them.

Dead-letter queues are useful for debugging your application or messaging system because they let you isolate problematic messages to determine why their processing doesn\'t succeed.

Amazon SQS doesn\'t automatically delete the message. Immediately after a message is received, it remains in the queue. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. Increasing visibility timeout will not help in troubleshooting the messages running into error or isolating them from the rest. Hence this is an incorrect option for the current use case.

Modify the Lambda function to publish messages with specific attributes to the SNS topic and apply the appropriate filter policy to the topic subscriptions An Amazon SNS topic is a logical access point that acts as a communication channel. A topic lets you group multiple endpoints (such as AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, or an email address). For example, to broadcast the messages of a message-producer system (such as, an e-commerce website) working with multiple other services that require its messages (for example, checkout and fulfillment systems), you can create a topic for your producer system. By default, an Amazon SNS topic subscriber receives every message that\'s published to the topic. To receive only a subset of the messages, a subscriber must assign a filter policy to the topic subscription. A filter policy is a JSON object containing properties that define which messages the subscriber receives. Amazon SNS supports policies that act on the message attributes or the message body, according to the filter policy scope that you set for the subscription. Filter policies for the message body assume that the message payload is a well-formed JSON object.

Provisioned concurrency � Provisioned concurrency initializes a requested number of execution environments so that they are prepared to respond immediately to your function\'s invocations. Note that configuring provisioned concurrency incurs charges to your AWS account. Neither reserved concurrency nor provisioned concurrency has any impact on the CPU available to a function, so both these options are incorrect Increase the function\'s CPU - This is a distractor as you cannot directly increase the CPU available to a function.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Share pre-signed URLs with resources that need access - All objects by default are private, with the object owner having permission to access the objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a pre-signed URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time- limited permission to download the objects. When you create a pre-signed URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object), and expiration date and time. The pre-signed URLs are valid only for the specified duration. Incorrect options: Use Bucket policy to block the unintended access - A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You add a bucket policy to a bucket to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users access permissions for the bucket and the objects in it. Bucket policy can be used to block off unintended access, but it\'s not possible to provide time-based access, as is the case in the current use case.

Benefits of Step Functions: Build and update apps quickly: AWS Step Functions lets you build visual workflows that enable the fast translation of business requirements into technical requirements. You can build applications in a matter of minutes, and when needs change, you can swap or reorganize components without customizing any code. Improve resiliency: AWS Step Functions manages state, checkpoints and restarts for you to make sure that your application executes in order and as expected.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Use CloudFront signed URL feature to control access to the file A signed URL includes additional information, for example, expiration date and time, that gives you more control over access to your content. Here\'s an overview of how you configure CloudFront for signed URLs and how CloudFront responds when a user uses a signed URL to request a file: In your CloudFront distribution, specify one or more trusted key groups, which contain the public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the URL signature. You use the corresponding private keys to sign the URLs. Develop your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content and to create signed URLs for the files or parts of your application that you want to restrict access to. A user requests a file for which you want to require signed URLs. Your application verifies that the user is entitled to access the file: they\'ve signed in, they\'ve paid for access to the content, or they\'ve met some other requirement for access. Your application creates and returns a signed URL to the user. The signed URL allows the user to download or stream the content. This step is automatic; the user usually doesn\'t have to do anything additional to access the content. For example, if a user is accessing your content in a web browser, your application returns the signed URL to the browser. The browser immediately uses the signed URL to access the file in the CloudFront edge cache without any intervention from the user. CloudFront uses the public key to validate the signature and confirm that the URL hasn\'t been tampered with. If the signature is invalid, the request is rejected. If the request meets the requirements in the policy statement, CloudFront does the standard operations: determines whether the file is already in the edge cache, forwards the request to the origin if necessary, and returns the file to the user.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Use Exponential Backoff technique to introduce delay in time before attempting to execute the operation again - A "Throttling � Maximum sending rate exceeded" error is retriable. This error is different than other errors returned by Amazon SES. A request rejected with a "Throttling" error can be retried at a later time and is likely to succeed. Retries are "selfish." In other words, when a client retries, it spends more of the server\'s time to get a higher chance of success. Where failures are rare or transient, that\'s not a problem. This is because the overall number of retried requests is small, and the tradeoff of increasing apparent availability works well. When failures are caused by overload, retries that increase load can make matters significantly worse. They can even delay recovery by keeping the load high long after the original issue is resolved. The preferred solution is to use a backoff. Instead of retrying immediately and aggressively, the client waits some amount of time between tries. The most common pattern is an exponential backoff, where the wait time is increased exponentially after every attempt. A variety of factors can affect your send rate, e.g. message size, network performance or Amazon SES availability. The advantage of the exponential backoff approach is that your application will self-tune and it will call Amazon SES at close to the maximum allowed rate. Incorrect options: Configure Timeout mechanism for each request made to the SES service - Requests are configured to timeout if they do not complete successfully in a given time. This helps free up the database, application and any other resource that could potentially keep on waiting to eventually succeed. But, if errors are caused by load, retries can be ineffective if all clients retry at the same time. Throttling error signifies that load is high on SES and it does not make sense to keep retrying. Raise a service request with Amazon to increase the throttling limit for the SES API - If throttling error is persistent, then it indicates a high load on the system consistently and increasing the throttling limit will be the right solution for the problem. But, the error is only intermittent here, signifying that decreasing the rate of requests will handle the error. Implement retry mechanism for all 4xx errors to avoid throttling error - 4xx status codes indicate that there was a problem with the client request.

This option does not address the issues in the use-case. Use Kinesis enhanced fan-out for Kinesis Data Streams - You should use enhanced fan-out if you have, or expect to have, multiple consumers retrieving data from a stream in parallel. Therefore, using enhanced fan-out will not help address the ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exception as the constraint is the capacity limit of the Kinesis Data Stream.

If you need to read an item that is larger than 4 KB, DynamoDB will need to consume additional read capacity units. 1) Item Size / 4KB, rounding to the nearest whole number. So, in the above case, 6KB / 4 KB = 1.5 or 2 read capacity units. 2) 1 read capacity unit per item (since strongly consistent read) � No of reads per second So, in the above case, 2 x 10 = 20 read capacity units.

Eventually Consistent Reads When you read data from a DynamoDB table, the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. Strongly Consistent Reads When you request a strongly consistent read, DynamoDB returns a response with the most up-to-date data, reflecting the updates from all prior write operations that were successful. DynamoDB uses eventually consistent reads by default. Read operations (such as GetItem, Query, and Scan) provide a ConsistentRead parameter. If you set this parameter to true, DynamoDB uses strongly consistent reads during the operation. As per the given use-case, to make sure that only the last updated value of any item is used in the application, you should use strongly consistent reads by setting ConsistentRead = true for GetItem operation. via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html Incorrect options: Use ConsistentRead = true while doing UpdateItem operation for any item Use ConsistentRead = true while doing PutItem operation for any item Use ConsistentRead = false while doing PutItem operation for any item As mentioned in the explanation above, strongly consistent reads apply only while using the read operations (such as GetItem, Query, and Scan).
