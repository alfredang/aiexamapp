    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'In Cisco SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Networking), the vSmart controller plays a crucial role in the overall orchestration and management of the SD-WAN deployment. It serves as the centralized brain of the SD-WAN architecture, providing policy-based control, intelligence, and coordination to the network. The vSmart controller performs the following key functions: Policy Distribution: The vSmart controller distributes policies to SD-WAN edge devices (routers) based on business and application requirements. These policies define how network traffic should be classified, prioritized, and routed across the SD-WAN infrastructure. The controller ensures consistent policy enforcement and real-time updates across all SD-WAN devices. Routing Intelligence: The vSmart controller uses its intelligence and awareness of the network topology, application performance, and available WAN links to make dynamic routing decisions. It leverages advanced algorithms to determine the optimal path for traffic based on parameters such as latency, packet loss, bandwidth, and application requirements. This dynamic routing helps optimize application performance and ensure efficient utilization of network resources. Security and Encryption: The vSmart controller enforces security policies and encryption across the SD-WAN deployment. It ensures that traffic is securely transmitted over the WAN by establishing encrypted tunnels between SD- WAN edge devices using technologies like IPsec. The controller centrally manages and enforces security policies, allowing for consistent and scalable security across the SD-WAN network. Network Visibility and Analytics: The vSmart controller collects and analyzes network data from the SD-WAN devices to provide administrators with comprehensive visibility into network performance, application usage, and user experience. It generates actionable insights and reports that help diagnose and troubleshoot network issues, monitor SLAs, and make informed decisions for network optimization. By performing these functions, the vSmart controller enables a unified and intelligent control plane for the SD-WAN deployment. It simplifies network management, enhances application performance, and improves overall agility and scalability. The vSmart controller acts as the central authority that ensures the SD- WAN network operates efficiently, adapts to changing conditions, and delivers the desired user experience and business outcomes.'

OMP serves as the control plane protocol that enables dynamic discovery, configuration, and exchange of routing information across the SD-WAN fabric. It provides a scalable and efficient means of distributing routing updates and propagating network reachability information among the SD- WAN devices, including edge routers, controllers, and vSmart controllers. OMP utilizes a hierarchical routing model, where the vSmart controllers act as the central orchestrators, distributing routing policies and updates to the edge routers. OMP allows for seamless integration of multiple transport types, such as MPLS, broadband, or cellular connections, and facilitates intelligent traffic steering based on policy-driven routing decisions. With its robust features and ability to adapt to changing network conditions, OMP plays a vital role in the Cisco SD-WAN solution, enabling optimized routing, enhanced performance, and simplified management of the SD-WAN fabric.'

    explanation: 'EIGRP and OSPF can both load balance over multiple equal-cost paths. EIGRP is unique in this regard, however, because it can also load balance over unequal cost paths if you configure it to do so. You use a variance command to control how the functionality works. EIGRP also uses a feasible successor approach which is a next best path alternative. The concept of Feasible Successor is a key component for achieving fast convergence and ensuring loop-free paths. A Feasible Successor is an alternate path to a destination network that meets the feasibility condition, making it a backup route for EIGRP. To qualify as a Feasible Successor, the advertised metric of the alternate path must be lower than the current successor\'s (best path) reported distance. EIGRP routers store information about Feasible Successors in their topology table. If the current successor becomes unavailable, the router can quickly transition to the Feasible Successor without waiting for the slow convergence process. This mechanism allows EIGRP to provide sub-second convergence by using pre-calculated backup routes, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity and improving network reliability.'

    ],
    correct: ['B'],
    explanation: 'The Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) provides a standardized method for dynamically bundling multiple physical links into a single logical link, increasing bandwidth and providing redundancy. LACP supports two modes of operation: Active Mode: In Active mode, a switch actively initiates LACP negotiations by sending LACP packets to the neighbor device. If the neighbor device supports LACP and is also in Active mode or Passive mode, a link aggregation group (LAG) is formed. Active mode enables the switch to actively negotiate and control the creation and maintenance of the LAG. This mode is typically used when the switch wants to aggregate links and actively manage the LACP process. Passive Mode: In Passive mode, the switch does not initiate LACP negotiations. It simply responds to LACP packets received from the neighbor device. If the neighbor device supports LACP and is in Active mode, a LAG is formed. Passive mode is typically used when the switch is intended to be a member of an LACP group but does not want to actively initiate or control the LACP process. It allows the switch to passively participate in LACP negotiations and form LAGs based on the requests received from the active end. Both Active and Passive modes of LACP provide a way for switches to negotiate and form link aggregation groups dynamically. The mode selection depends on the desired level of control and initiation required for link aggregation in a particular network configuration.'

    explanation: 'In Cisco wireless networks, mobility groups play a crucial role in enabling seamless roaming and mobility between different access points (APs) within the network. A mobility group is a logical grouping of APs that share information and collaborate to ensure uninterrupted connectivity for wireless clients as they move throughout the coverage area. APs within the same mobility group exchange information about client associations, RF conditions, and network status, allowing them to make informed decisions when clients need to be handed off from one AP to another. By sharing this information, APs can coordinate client roaming, ensuring a smooth transition as clients move from one AP to another without experiencing service interruptions or disconnections. Mobility groups also facilitate load balancing by allowing APs to share client load information and distribute client connections across the available APs, optimizing network performance and capacity. In summary, mobility groups in Cisco wireless networks enhance roaming capabilities and enable efficient load balancing, providing a seamless and reliable wireless experience for connected clients.'

    explanation: 'BPDUGuard is a feature in Cisco\'s Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) implementation that helps protect against the unintended connection of switches or bridge devices to ports designated for end devices. BPDUGuard enables the switch port to immediately transition into an error-disabled state if it receives any Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs), which are control messages exchanged between switches in a spanning tree network. When BPDUGuard is enabled on a port, it monitors for BPDUs. If a BPDU is detected on the port, it signifies the presence of another switch or bridge device, indicating a potential loop in the network. In such cases, BPDUGuard shuts down the port to prevent the creation of loops and ensures the stability and integrity of the spanning tree.

    explanation: 'In Cisco UCS (Unified Computing System), there are two options for IP address assignment for vNICs (virtual Network Interface Cards): Static IP Address Assignment: With this option, an IP address is manually assigned to the vNIC. Administrators can configure the desired IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and other relevant network parameters directly in the UCS management interface using pools. Static IP address assignment provides control and predictability as the IP address remains fixed unless manually modified. It is typically used when a specific IP address needs to be assigned to a vNIC for consistent network configuration or when using IP address management (IPAM) tools. Dynamic IP Address Assignment (DHCP): Dynamic IP address assignment allows vNICs to obtain their IP addresses dynamically from a DHCP server. The vNIC is configured to act as a DHCP client, and upon booting or connecting to the network, it sends a DHCP request to the DHCP server. The server responds with an available IP address, subnet mask, and other network parameters, which are automatically assigned to the vNIC. Dynamic IP address assignment offers flexibility and automation, particularly in environments where IP address management and scalability are essential.

They are installed directly on the physical hardware of a server and serve as the primary operating system for managing and running virtual machines (VMs). Here are the key characteristics and features of Type 1 hypervisors: Hardware-level Access: Type 1 hypervisors have direct access to the underlying hardware resources, bypassing the need for a host operating system. This direct access allows for efficient utilization of system resources and better performance. Efficient Resource Allocation: Type 1 hypervisors allocate hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to virtual machines. They manage resource sharing and ensure each VM receives its allocated portion, optimizing resource utilization and preventing resource conflicts. Isolation and Security: Type 1 hypervisors provide strong isolation between virtual machines, preventing one VM from affecting others. They use features like memory and device isolation to maintain strict boundaries and enhance security. Virtual Machine Management: Type 1 hypervisors offer advanced management capabilities for VMs, including creation, configuration, and migration. They allow administrators to provision, monitor, and manage VMs independently of each other. Hypervisor-level Drivers: Type 1 hypervisors include specialized drivers that interface directly with the underlying hardware, enabling efficient communication between VMs and hardware resources.

When a packet arrives at a Cisco router, the first step in the forwarding process is to consult the RIB to determine the best path or next-hop for the packet. The RIB performs the route lookup based on the packet\'s destination IP address. It searches the routing table for a matching route entry and selects the most specific route that matches the destination IP address. Once the RIB identifies the best path or next-hop for the packet, it passes this information to the Forwarding Information Base (FIB).

    explanation: 'In a Cisco router running OSPF, several timers are available to control various aspects of OSPF behavior. These timers help regulate OSPF operations and ensure efficient convergence and neighbor discovery. Here are the commonly used timers in OSPF on a Cisco router: Hello Timer: The OSPF Hello timer controls the frequency at which OSPF Hello packets are sent to discover and maintain OSPF neighbor relationships. It determines how often a router sends Hello packets to its directly connected neighbors to establish and maintain adjacency. The default value is 10 seconds on broadcast networks and 30 seconds on non-broadcast networks. Dead Timer: The OSPF Dead timer specifies the length of time a router waits to hear a Hello packet from its neighbor before considering the neighbor as unreachable or dead. If the router doesn\'t receive a Hello packet within this time period, it declares the neighbor as down. The default value is four times the Hello interval. SPF Timer: The SPF (Shortest Path First) timer determines the frequency at which the router recalculates its routing table using the SPF algorithm to find the shortest paths to destination networks. It defines how often the router performs the SPF calculation based on changes in the network topology. The default value is every 5 seconds. LSA Retransmission Timer: The LSA (Link State Advertisement) retransmission timer specifies the duration for which the router waits before retransmitting a particular LSA to a neighbor. This timer ensures reliable LSA exchange and synchronization between OSPF routers. The default value is 5 seconds. LSA Max Age Timer: The LSA Max Age timer sets the maximum time an LSA is considered valid within the OSPF network. If an LSA is not refreshed within this time period, it is considered expired and removed from the OSPF database. The default value is 1 hour. These timers can be adjusted based on network requirements, topology size, and convergence needs. Properly configuring and tuning these timers on Cisco routers help optimize OSPF operation, network stability, and convergence time.'

    explanation: 'In LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol), two key namespaces are used: the EID (Endpoint Identifier) namespace and the RLOC (Routing Locator) namespace. The EID namespace refers to the identifiers assigned to endpoints in a LISP network. An EID can represent various types of identifiers, such as IP addresses or MAC addresses, that uniquely identify endpoints within the LISP domain. The purpose of the EID is to provide a stable and consistent identity for the endpoints, independent of their current location or network attachment point. EIDs are used to establish communication between endpoints in a LISP network, and they remain constant even if the endpoints move or change their network attachment. On the other hand, the RLOC namespace represents the locators or routing locators used in the LISP network. RLOCs are the addresses associated with the devices (routers) that participate in the LISP infrastructure. These addresses are used to route traffic within the LISP network and provide the necessary information for encapsulating and forwarding packets between different locations. RLOCs can be IP addresses assigned to the edge routers or other routing-related identifiers. The separation of the EID and RLOC namespaces is a fundamental aspect of LISP\'s architecture. It allows for the decoupling of endpoint identities from their current location or network attachment, enabling mobility and scalability within the network. This separation facilitates the efficient routing and forwarding of packets in LISP networks by using the EID-to-RLOC mapping system to associate the EIDs of the endpoints with their corresponding RLOCs.'

Nonbroadcast Network Type: In a nonbroadcast network, such as a Frame Relay or ATM network, direct communication between OSPF routers is not possible. To overcome this limitation, OSPF elects a DR and BDR to act as intermediary routers for exchanging routing information. The DR and BDR are responsible for maintaining adjacency with all other routers within the nonbroadcast network. When an OSPF router is configured for the nonbroadcast network type, it forms adjacencies only with the DR and BDR. The DR and BDR, in turn, establish adjacencies with all other routers in the network. This reduces the number of OSPF adjacencies required within the nonbroadcast network, resulting in more efficient OSPF operation.

In EIGRP, the delay component of the metric is based on the cumulative delay of all the network segments along the path. The lower the delay value, the more desirable the route, as it indicates shorter transmission times. By default, EIGRP uses a composite metric formula that incorporates both bandwidth and delay. The specific formula for the metric calculation can vary depending on the EIGRP version and configuration, but it generally involves combining the bandwidth and delay values in a mathematical equation. By considering both bandwidth and delay, EIGRP aims to select paths that offer high capacity (bandwidth) and low latency (delay). This helps ensure efficient utilization of network resources and optimal path selection for routing packets. It\'s important to note that other factors, such as reliability and load, can also be included in the EIGRP metric calculation by configuring additional components. However, bandwidth and delay are the two default components that are always present in the EIGRP metric calculation.'

    explanation: 'In Cisco Control Plane Policing (CoPP), an access list is used to identify traffic types or specific network flows that need to be classified and controlled at the control plane level. CoPP is a mechanism that allows administrators to prioritize and manage the traffic that reaches the control plane of a Cisco device. By implementing access control lists (ACLs) in CoPP, specific traffic can be identified and subjected to policy-based control and rate limiting. To identify traffic types in Cisco CoPP using an access list, the following steps are typically involved: Traffic Classification: The access list is configured to match specific criteria or characteristics of the traffic flow, such as source IP address, destination IP address, protocol type, or port numbers. This allows for the identification of specific traffic types or network flows that need to be controlled. Access Control Entry (ACE) Configuration: Access control entries (ACEs) are defined within the access list to specify the matching criteria for the traffic. Each ACE contains the specific attributes of the traffic flow to be matched. CoPP Configuration: The access list is then associated with the CoPP configuration on the Cisco device. CoPP policies are defined to determine the action to be taken on the matched traffic. This can include rate limiting, dropping, or forwarding the traffic to the control plane for processing. Traffic Control: Once the CoPP policy is applied, traffic that matches the criteria defined in the access list is subjected to the specified control actions. This ensures that critical control plane traffic is prioritized and protected from excessive or malicious traffic that could potentially impact the device\'s operation or security. By using an access list in CoPP, administrators can have fine-grained control over the types of traffic that reach the control plane of a Cisco device. This helps ensure that the control plane remains available, responsive, and protected, even in the face of high traffic loads or potential threats.'

    explanation: 'On Cisco routers, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) IP is the default tunnel mode because it is a widely supported and versatile encapsulation protocol that enables the creation of virtual point-to-point links over an IP network. GRE IP operates by encapsulating packets from one network protocol within IP packets, effectively creating a tunnel that allows these packets to traverse networks that do not support the encapsulated protocol natively. This encapsulation allows for the transmission of non-IP traffic across IP networks. The reason GRE IP is the default tunnel mode on Cisco routers is due to its flexibility and compatibility. It can encapsulate a wide range of protocols, including IPv4, IPv6, IPX, AppleTalk, and more. This versatility makes it suitable for various networking scenarios and ensures interoperability with different network devices and vendors. Additionally, GRE IP provides features like tunnel endpoint addressing, fragmentation support, and routing capabilities, allowing routers to route traffic through GRE tunnels efficiently. These features contribute to GRE IP\'s popularity and its selection as the default tunnel mode on Cisco routers.'

When using PATCH with RESTCONF, clients can send a request to modify or update a specific resource, such as a configuration element or a data object, without needing to send the entire representation of the resource. Instead, the PATCH request includes only the changes or modifications that need to be applied to the resource. The server receiving the PATCH request interprets the changes and applies them to the resource, effectively updating it while preserving the existing data that was not explicitly modified. This approach is particularly useful in RESTCONF, as it minimizes the amount of data transferred between the client and the server, optimizing network bandwidth and reducing the overhead associated with sending and processing full resource representations. By utilizing PATCH in RESTCONF, clients can efficiently perform targeted updates to resources, maintaining a flexible and efficient update functionality within the RESTful API architecture.'

The PETR router acts as a proxy and resides at the edge of the LISP domain, connecting the LISP-capable devices within the domain to the devices outside the domain. When a LISP-capable device inside the domain wants to communicate with a device outside the domain, the PETR router acts as an intermediary. It receives packets from the LISP-capable device and encapsulates them with an additional LISP header. The PETR router then forwards the encapsulated packets to the ETR (Egress Tunnel Router) of the destination network, which decapsulates them and delivers them to the final destination. By performing this proxy function, the PETR router enables seamless communication between LISP-enabled devices and devices outside the LISP domain, allowing for efficient and scalable routing in LISP networks.'

It provides a mechanism to control and limit the number of devices allowed to connect to a switch port based on their MAC addresses. In the access layer, where end-user devices such as computers, printers, and IP phones are connected, Cisco port security can be configured to achieve the following: Limiting the Number of MAC Addresses: Port security allows administrators to specify the maximum number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a particular switch port. This helps prevent unauthorized devices or rogue devices from connecting to the network. Once the limit is reached, additional devices attempting to connect will be denied access. Specifying Secure MAC Addresses: Administrators can define a list of specific MAC addresses that are authorized to connect to a switch port. This ensures that only trusted devices are allowed access, providing an additional layer of security. Detecting Violations: Cisco port security can monitor and detect any violation attempts, such as the connection of unauthorized devices or the movement of authorized devices to different switch ports. Violations can trigger actions like logging the event, shutting down the port, or sending notifications to the network administrator. Secure Aging: Administrators can configure port security with aging timers, allowing learned MAC addresses to be dynamically removed from the secure MAC address table after a specified period of inactivity.

    explanation: 'In EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol), when a prefix is marked as ACTIVE in the topology table, it indicates that EIGRP is actively searching for a feasible successor or a loop-free alternate path to reach that prefix. Here are a few scenarios where prefixes might be marked as ACTIVE: Initial Route Computation: When EIGRP first starts or when a network change occurs, the topology table may contain prefixes marked as ACTIVE. During this initial computation, EIGRP is actively calculating the best path to reach those prefixes. Route Recomputation: If a link failure or a change in network conditions occurs, EIGRP needs to recompute the routes. During this process, prefixes that were previously marked as passive may become ACTIVE as EIGRP searches for alternative paths. Lack of Feasible Successor: EIGRP uses the concept of feasible successors to maintain loop-free paths. A feasible successor is a neighboring router that has a backup path to a destination prefix. If there is no feasible successor available for a prefix, EIGRP marks it as ACTIVE and starts the process of finding an alternate path. Limited Bandwidth or High Delay: If the bandwidth on a link is limited or the delay is high, EIGRP may mark the prefixes associated with that link as ACTIVE. This indicates that EIGRP is actively searching for a more optimal path with better bandwidth or lower delay. The ACTIVE state in the EIGRP topology table signifies that the routing process is actively searching for a suitable path to reach the destination prefix. Once a feasible successor or an alternate path is found, the prefix transitions to the passive state in the topology table, indicating a loop-free path is available.'

CTS enables the creation of security policies based on contextual attributes such as user identity, device type, location, and time of access. It uses these attributes to define and enforce access policies at the network edge. By integrating with ISE, CTS allows for dynamic policy enforcement throughout the network infrastructure, including switches, routers, and wireless access points. With CTS, the network can be logically divided into multiple security domains or "trustsec domains." These domains provide segmentation and isolation, allowing for the implementation of security policies specific to each domain. CTS employs Security Group Tags (SGTs) and Security Group ACLs (SGACLs) to classify and enforce access policies at the endpoint level. SGTs are applied to endpoints, while SGACLs define the allowed traffic between different SGTs.

The WLC acts as a central control point for managing and coordinating the APs within the wireless network. When it comes to authentication, the WLC offers a comprehensive set of options and configurations. It supports various authentication methods, such as 802.1X/EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), web authentication, and MAC filtering. These methods allow the WLC to authenticate wireless clients connecting to the network and enforce security policies. Additionally, the WLC integrates with external authentication servers, such as RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service), LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), or Active Directory, to leverage existing user databases for authentication purposes. Through its intuitive interface, the local WLC simplifies the setup and management of authentication, ensuring secure and seamless access for wireless users in the Cisco lightweight AP environment.'

    ],
    correct: ['C'],
    explanation: 'The spine-leaf networking topology, also known as leaf-spine architecture, provides predictable latency due to its design characteristics. In this topology, leaf switches are directly connected to spine switches in a full mesh fashion, creating a predictable and consistent path for network traffic. Each leaf switch is connected to every spine switch, ensuring multiple parallel paths for traffic distribution and minimizing bottlenecks. This balanced connectivity pattern significantly reduces the number of hops required for data to traverse the network, resulting in low and predictable latency. Additionally, the spine switches act as high- speed fabric interconnects, allowing for efficient and fast communication between leaf switches. The equal and symmetric nature of the spine-leaf topology, with its uniform connectivity and optimized paths, enables network engineers to achieve predictable latency for applications and services running across the network. This makes it particularly well-suited for latency-sensitive environments such as data centers or real-time applications where consistent and low-latency performance is essential.'

    explanation: 'EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) possesses the capability to load balance across unequal cost paths, a feature that OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) lacks. EIGRP achieves this through its sophisticated metric calculation known as composite metric, which takes into account multiple factors such as bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load. By considering these factors, EIGRP can accurately calculate the best path to a destination, even if the available paths have different costs. This allows EIGRP to distribute traffic across multiple paths, providing load balancing and efficient utilization of available network resources. In contrast, OSPF uses a simple metric based solely on the cost of the path, which is typically calculated based on the link bandwidth. As a result, OSPF does not support load balancing across unequal cost paths, as it selects the path with the lowest cost as the best path and does not consider other factors.'

    explanation: 'The available BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) neighbor states are as follows: Idle: The initial state of a BGP neighbor. In this state, the router has not yet established a TCP connection with its BGP neighbor. Connect: This state occurs when the router is attempting to establish a TCP connection with its BGP neighbor. Active: If the Connect state fails, the neighbor transitions to the Active state. In this state, the router continuously tries to establish a TCP connection with the neighbor by sending TCP SYN packets. OpenSent: After a successful TCP connection, the router transitions to the OpenSent state. In this state, the router sends an OPEN message to its neighbor to initiate the BGP session establishment process. OpenConfirm: Upon receiving an OPEN message from the neighbor, the router transitions to the OpenConfirm state. It verifies the received parameters, such as BGP version and autonomous system number (ASN), and prepares to send a KEEPALIVE message. Established: Once both routers have exchanged KEEPALIVE messages, they enter the Established state. In this state, the BGP peering session is fully established, and the routers exchange routing information. These neighbor states represent the progression of a BGP session from its initial setup to a fully established and operational state. The states provide insight into the current status of the BGP neighbors and allow for effective troubleshooting and monitoring of BGP peering sessions.'

    correct: ['C'],
    explanation: 'When using IP GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation), fragmentation issues can arise due to the potential mismatch between the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) of the encapsulated packets and the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the underlying network. However, both MSS and Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) can assist in mitigating these fragmentation issues. MSS refers to the maximum size of the payload that can be carried in a single TCP segment. By appropriately adjusting the MSS value, the encapsulating GRE router can ensure that the encapsulated packets fit within the MTU of the network path. This prevents fragmentation of the encapsulated packets, improving performance and reducing the likelihood of packet loss or reassembly delays. PMTUD, on the other hand, is a mechanism used to dynamically discover the maximum MTU along the network path. When a packet encounters an MTU smaller than its own size, the sender is notified through ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) messages, indicating that the packet needs to be fragmented or the MTU should be adjusted. PMTUD enables the sender to adapt its packet size to the discovered MTU, avoiding fragmentation issues and optimizing the transmission efficiency of IP GRE packets. By adjusting the MSS value and leveraging PMTUD, IP GRE deployments can effectively address fragmentation challenges. This ensures that encapsulated packets fit within the MTU of the network path, optimizing performance, reducing overhead, and minimizing the likelihood of fragmentation-related issues.'

    correct: ['B', 'D'],
    explanation: 'In Cisco SD-Access solutions, a fabric edge node performs two crucial jobs: LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol) endpoint registration and VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) encapsulation. LISP Endpoint Registration: The fabric edge node acts as an intermediary between the endpoint devices and the SD-Access fabric. It registers the endpoint devices\' IP addresses with the fabric controller using LISP. LISP provides a mechanism for separating the identity (ID) of an endpoint device from its location (Locator). By registering the endpoint\'s IP address, the fabric controller can associate it with the appropriate network policy, security attributes, and service provisioning. This allows for dynamic policy enforcement, seamless mobility, and simplified network management in the SD-Access fabric. VXLAN Encapsulation: The fabric edge node encapsulates the endpoint traffic in VXLAN tunnels. VXLAN is used to extend Layer 2 connectivity across a Layer 3 network infrastructure. When an endpoint sends data, the fabric edge node adds a VXLAN header to the Ethernet frame. The VXLAN header includes a VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) that helps identify the virtual network to which the endpoint belongs. This encapsulated packet is then transmitted across the SD-Access fabric, enabling the endpoint to communicate with other devices in the same virtual network. VXLAN encapsulation facilitates network virtualization, segmentation, and allows for scalable and flexible deployment of SD-Access fabrics. By performing LISP endpoint registration and VXLAN encapsulation, the fabric edge node ensures proper connectivity, policy enforcement, and secure communication within the Cisco SD-Access solution. It plays a pivotal role in integrating endpoint devices into the fabric, enabling seamless mobility, and facilitating virtual network services.'

    explanation: 'In Cisco\'s VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), Transparent mode is one of the operating modes available for VTP-enabled switches. When a Cisco switch is configured in Transparent mode, it does not participate in VTP advertisements or share VLAN configuration information with other switches in the network. Instead, it maintains its VLAN database locally and forwards VTP advertisements received on trunk links to other switches without making any changes to its own VLAN configuration. This mode allows for manual configuration of VLANs on the switch, providing greater control over VLAN management. In Transparent mode, the switch will forward VTP updates to ensure other switches receive them, but it will not update its own VLAN information based on those updates. It is often used when there is a need to maintain VLAN information independently or when introducing a switch into an existing VTP domain without affecting the VLAN configuration.'
