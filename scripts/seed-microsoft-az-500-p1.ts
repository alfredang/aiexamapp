Blob versioning enables you to maintain multiple versions of a blob, allowing you to revert to a previous version in case of accidental deletion or modification. This feature helps ensure data resiliency and protection against accidental deletions in Azure Blob Storage. Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) replicates your data within the same data center to ensure high availability and data resiliency. While LRS enhances data resiliency, it is not specifically designed to protect against accidental deletion in Azure Blob Storage. Immutable storage for Azure Blob Storage enables users to store business-critical data in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state.

The configuration for this alert allows you to specify at what user risk level you want the alert to be generated. For example, if you set the policy to alert on medium user risk and a user\'s risk score moves to medium risk because of a real-time sign-in risk, you\'ll receive the `users at risk detected\' email.
