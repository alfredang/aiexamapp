But few services, by definition, need to be in a global scope because of the underlying service they offer. AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM), Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53 and AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) are some of the global services. AWS Lambda AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. AWS Lambda is a regional service. Amazon Rekognition With Amazon Rekognition, you can identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos, as well as detect any inappropriate content. Amazon Rekognition also provides highly accurate facial analysis and facial search capabilities that you can use to detect, analyze, and compare faces for a wide variety of user verification, people counting, and public safety use cases. Amazon Rekognition is a regional service. Incorrect options: AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) - AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM), you can create and manage IAM users and IAM user groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. Amazon CloudFront - Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment. AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) - By using AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF), you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) on your CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. As mentioned earlier, these three services are global in scope. Exam Alert: Amazon S3 - Amazon S3 is a unique service in the sense that it follows a global namespace but the buckets are regional.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Read Replica improves database scalability Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Read Replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. Read Replicas are used for improved read performance. You can also place your read replica in a different AWS Region closer to your users for better performance. Read Replicas are an example of horizontal scaling of resources. Read Replica Overview: via - https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/ Exam Alert: Please review the differences between Amazon RDS Multi-AZ, Multi-Region and Read Replica deployments for RDS: via - https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/ Incorrect options: Read Replica enhances database availability - Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for RDS database (DB) instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Read Replica cannot enhance database availability. Read Replica protects the database from a regional failure - You need to use RDS in Multi-Region deployment configuration to protect from a regional failure. Read Replica cannot protect from a regional failure. Read Replica reduces database usage costs - Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) with Read Replicas increases the database costs compared to the standard deployment.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Operational Excellence The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. The AWS Well- Architected Framework is based on six pillars -- Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization and Sustainability. The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. In the cloud, you can apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire environment. You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their execution by triggering them in response to events. Incorrect options: Cost Optimization - Cost Optimization focuses on avoiding un-needed costs. Key topics include understanding and controlling where the money is being spent, selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types, analyzing spend over time, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending. Performance Efficiency - The performance efficiency pillar focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently. Key topics include selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve. Security - The security pillar focuses on protecting information & systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, identifying and managing who can do what with privilege management, protecting systems, and establishing controls to detect security events.

      { id: 'C', text: 'Dedicated Host' },
      { id: 'D', text: 'On-Demand Instance' }
    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Spot Instance A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. Amazon EC2 Pricing Options Overview: via - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ Incorrect options: On-Demand Instance - An On- Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle -- you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct. Reserved Instance (RI) - Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not as cost-effective as spot instances, so this option is not correct. Dedicated Host - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They\'re not cost-efficient compared to spot instances. So this option is not correct. Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/'

    explanation: 'Correct option: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users AWS recommends that you require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users in your account. With multi-factor authentication (MFA), users have a device that generates a response to an authentication challenge. Both the user\'s credentials and the device-generated response are required to complete the sign-in process. Rotate credentials regularly AWS recommends that you change your own passwords and access keys regularly, and make sure that all IAM users in your account do as well. That way, if a password or access key is compromised without your knowledge, you limit how long the credentials can be used to access your resources. You can apply a password policy to your account to require all your IAM users to rotate their passwords. AWS IAM security best practices: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html Incorrect options: Create a minimum number of accounts and share these account credentials among employees - AWS recommends that user account credentials should not be shared between users.

Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. You can copy objects between different AWS Regions or within the same Region. Although Amazon S3 stores your data across multiple geographically distant Availability Zones by default, compliance requirements might dictate that you store data at even greater distances. S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR) allows you to replicate data between distant AWS Regions to satisfy these requirements. Incorrect options: Use S3 same-region replication (S3 SRR) to replicate data between distant AWS Regions - S3 same-region replication (S3 SRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS Region, so this option is incorrect.

    explanation: 'Correct options: Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale. A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS. Instance Store An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your EC2 instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Instance storage is temporary, data is lost if instance experiences failure or is terminated. Amazon EC2 instance store cannot be used for file sharing between instances. Incorrect options: Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed, elastic NFS file system. It is built to scale on-demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth.

    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'Correct option: Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). Agility - Agility refers to the ability of the cloud to give you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them � from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more. Incorrect options: Elasticity - With cloud computing elasticity, you don\'t have to over-provision resources upfront to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the number of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change. Cost savings - The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. Ability to deploy globally in minutes - With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.

    explanation: 'Correct option: VPC Endpoint A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface endpoints and gateway endpoints. An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses. A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. The following AWS services are supported: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Amazon DynamoDB Exam Alert: You may see a question around this concept in the exam. Just remember that only Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB support VPC gateway endpoint. All other services that support VPC Endpoints use a VPC interface endpoint (note that Amazon S3 supports the VPC interface endpoint as well). Incorrect options: AWS Direct Connect - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC. This private connection takes at least one month for completion. AWS Transit Gateway - AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router � each new connection is only made once. This service is helpful in reducing the complex topology of VPC peering when a lot of systems are involved.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Use Amazon CloudFront to improve the performance of your website You can use Amazon CloudFront to improve the performance of your website. Amazon CloudFront makes your website files (such as HTML, images, and video) available from data centers around the world (called edge locations). When a visitor requests a file from your website, Amazon CloudFront automatically redirects the request to a copy of the file at the nearest edge location. This results in faster download times than if the visitor had requested the content from a data center that is located farther away. Incorrect options: Use Amazon CloudFormation to improve the performance of your website - AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. CloudFormation cannot be used to improve the performance of a static website. Use AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) to improve the performance of your website - By using AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF), you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) on your CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. Besides, by using AWS WAF\'s rate-based rules, you can automatically block the IP addresses of bad actors when requests matching a rule exceed a threshold that you define. WAF cannot be used to improve the performance of a static website.
