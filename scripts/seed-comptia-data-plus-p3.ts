Pearson\'s correlation coefficient is a calculation used to measure a linear relationship between data points and returns an r value that is plus or minus 1 to determine the strength of the relationship. An r value that is close to 1 indicates a strong correlation between values and a value of or close to 0 means indicates that there is no correlation. Correlation is the statistical association between two or more equal variables. Correlation does not tell an analyst that a variable influences another, but it does indicate that if one variable changes, the other variable changes as well.

Statistical significance indicated that an event must not have happened by chance and is repeatable.

An infographic is any combination of visuals, artwork, photos, and language that tells a story about data in a compelling and appealing way.

This data changes less frequently and is intended for dimension data, not transactional data. The data dictionary is a critical part of master data management and an important resource for a data analyst.
