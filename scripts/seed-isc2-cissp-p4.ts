      { id: 'D', text: 'Clearly define security responsibilities between the organization and the cloud provider.' }
    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'OBJ. 3.5 - In serverless computing, the organization does not control the underlying infrastructure, which makes limiting sensitive data usage crucial for reducing risk. While security responsibilities should be defined and the attack surface may be larger, the primary concern is the limited control over the environment, necessitating caution when handling sensitive data.

    ],
    correct: ['A'],
    explanation: 'OBJ. 2.4 - Regularly reviewing data ownership ensures that the right individuals maintain oversight and control over the organization\'s data. This is crucial as organizational structures and responsibilities may change, potentially leaving data unmanaged or improperly overseen.

    correct: ['C'],
    explanation: 'OBJ. 4.2 - MadMac can be used to change MAC addresses to avoid network security measures, such as MAC filtering or port security settings that rely on a fixed MAC address for device identification. While MAC spoofing can be used in ARP attacks, the primary use of MadMac is likely to evade these specific access control mechanisms rather than ARP manipulation.

It is created to implement specific actions that align with strategic goals but focus on prompt execution, making it ideal for quickly addressing the organization\'s current security risks. A strategic plan focuses on long-term objectives, and an operational plan governs ongoing processes. A security plan is too general and may encompass several tactical and strategic elements.
