    explanation: 'In Power BI, you can create groups to categorize a range of data. In the given question, we need to group individual dates into weeks, so you can perform analysis of sales data by week. Right-click on the Date field (in the Sales table) and click New group. In the Groups window, you can select the Group type as either \'List\' or \'Bin\'. Use List to group text fields. And use Bin to group numerical and date fields. Since we need to group individual dates, we cannot use List as the Group type. So, the option Create a new group with Group type set to List is incorrect. Once we select the Group type as Bin, we choose the Bin Type. There are two options: � Size of bins and � Number of bins Both would work. But, choosing Size of bins works better as we exactly know each bin\'s size: A week or seven days. On the contrary, choosing Number of bins isn\'t an elegant solution. We cannot decide on the Bin count, especially, if new data can be loaded in the future. Additionally, we wouldn\'t be able to size the Bins at exactly 7 days. So, the option Create a new group with Group type set to Bin and Bin Type set to Number of bins is incorrect. And, the option Create a new group with Group type set to Bin and Bin Type set to Size of bins is the correct answer. In the below representation, Order Date (bins) is the created group that groups the individual Order Dates.

Add a new column No. of. transactions (counts the number of rows for each customer). 2. Sort the rows by descending order of No. of. transactions. 3. Keep the first 40 rows. Query folding is the ability of the Power Query engine to translate all the above-applied transformations on the fact table into a single SQL query. Power Query can then dispatch the SQL query to data sources like SQL Server, which has a higher capacity, leading to efficient data refreshes. You can view if Power Query can generate an equivalent SQL query for all the transformations by right-clicking the last step -> View Native Query. If the View Native Query option is disabled, it\'s more likely that the query cannot fold to the source. Else, the query can fold and you can view the generated SQL Query. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-folding#determine-when-a-query-can-be-folded View Native Query can indicate whether all the steps can be folded to the source. Option A is incorrect. You can also check if query folding occurs using the Query Diagnostics tool in Power Query. Select the step (the last one) to analyze and click Diagnose Step. Power Query generates four additional queries (based on the Query Diagnostics Options). Navigate to the aggregated query. You will see a table of rows. Since we know that the last query fetches 40 rows, we can apply a filter on the Row Count column to view the generated Data Source Query.

The Current Value field specifies the current active value of the parameter. 4. Once you create a parameter, it is added as a query, similar to other queries. Next, use this parameter to connect to SQL Server. If you have any parameters in your data model, you will see an option to select either \'Text\' or a \'Parameter.\' Choose parameter and select the parameter serverName. Since the Current Value of the parameter points to a Dev environment (see earlier image), this SQL Server connection connects to the data source in the Dev environment. Once you test your reports in the Dev environment, 1. Navigate to Transform data -> Edit parameters. 2. In the Edit Parameters window, choose another environment/server name. The newly selected environment will be the Current Value of the parameter. When you connect to SQL Server using the parameter, you will connect to the selected environment. The option Create Power Query parameters is the correct choice.

They play a key role in influencing the low ratings (the metric) you receive. Put simply, you need to understand the concerns of consumers in the customer organization and address them to tackle the problem of low ratings. Coming to the question, the dotted average line indicates the percentage of roles other than the key influencer who gave low ratings. Since consumer is a key influencer, it follows that the average line indicates the percentage of Administrators and Publishers who gave low ratings. We can verify this from the dataset (Go to Customer Table in the .pbix file). Average = Administrators & Publishers who gave low ratings / Total no. of. Administrators and Publishers.

Or, in the Power BI model In general, a query running close to the source is more efficient than one that must transfer a set of data to Power Query/Power BI for further transformation. Moreover, it is a recommended best practice to filter your data as early as possible, so you only work with the relevant data. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/best- practices#filter-early Writing a native SQL query with a WHERE clause is one of the best options to view the sample data in your Power BI model. If you have access to the source database, you can even create database views to import the desired data. Option A is one of the correct answers. There isn\'t much difference between writing a native SQL query and using Power Query to filter the sample data since Power Query will eventually fold the query to the source SQL Server (Query folding refers to the ability of Power Query to generate an equivalent SQL query to retrieve data from the source). Reference Link: https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Power-Query-Vs-SQL-Efficiency/m-p/572023 For example, once you filter the required data in Power Query, right-click the last step Filtered Rows within the Applied Steps section (on the right). Then, select View Native Query. The Power Query engine generates a SQL Query (encompassing all the actions performed in the Power Query editor). During data import, it folds this query back to the SQL Server. So, using Power Query editor to filter the data is an equally efficient method to import the sample data. Note: Query folding happens only for the supported data sources/data transformations performed in Power Query. Read this article to understand the transformations/data sources that support query folding: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-folding Option B is another correct answer. You cannot use DAX functions to import data from the SQL Server database. You can only use SQL statements. So, if you ever use the DAX FILTER function to sample the data, it is at the Power BI layer. As I have already explained, it is a best practice to filter your data as early as possible, so you only work with the relevant data.

    explanation: 'All the given formulas appear similar. But they perform different functions. The syntax for both DATEADD and PARALLELPERIOD functions are the same. They both shift the dates backward/forward by the given interval. From the given options for DATEADD & PARALLELPERIOD, YEAR � indicates what level shifts -1 � indicates by how much The only difference is DATEADD honors the filter context whereas, PARALLELPERIOD does not. So, the given formula for DATEADD shifts the dates exactly one year backward, irrespective of whether the calculation happens at the year level or the month level (it honors both the month & the year filter from the filter context). Here is how PARALLELPERIOD works. a. Since the interval in the given function is a YEAR, PARALLELPERIOD operates at the YEAR level b. Shifts the dates one year back (-1, YEAR) c. For every month, it returns the dates for the entire year 2011 (it ignores the filter context month). Finally, the CALCULATE function computes the same result (total revenue last year) for every month of current year. Since we need to display last year\'s total revenue for each month, the given DAX formula for DATEADD is one of the correct answers. And the given formula for PARALLELPERIOD is incorrect.

PARALLELPERIOD operates at the MONTH level b. Shifts the dates 12 months back, and returns only the dates for the specific months (we get desired dates as the function works at the MONTH level, instead of the YEAR level). SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR is derived from DATEADD & is a specialized version of DATEADD with: No. of. intervals set to -1, and Interval set to YEAR. Both the below formulas return the same result. CALCULATE ( [Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR ( \'Date\'[Date] ) ) CALCULATE ( [Revenue], DATEADD ( \'Date\'[Date], -1, YEAR ) ) So, the DAX formula that uses SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR is also a correct choice. On the other hand, PREVIOUSYEAR is derived from PARALLELPERIOD & is a specialized version of PARALLELPERIOD with: No. of. intervals set to -1 and Interval set to YEAR.

    explanation: 'Let\'s create a calculated column for EBITDA margin as per the definition given in the question. And display EBITDA margin on a card visual. Change the default summarization from SUM to AVERAGE as the sum of percentages doesn\'t make sense. Everything looks perfect. But there is a flaw in the calculation. We need EBITDA margin (EBITDA as a percentage of its Revenue). So, the calculation should display a ratio of EBITDA to Revenue. To put it more concretely, we need to display a ratio of the aggregation of EBITDA to the aggregation of Revenue. But, the calculated column, first, calculates a ratio for every row. And then, we aggregate the ratio (by using the implicit function AVERAGE). This produces incorrect value. Instead of displaying a ratio of the aggregations (of EBITDA & Revenue), we are displaying aggregation of the individual ratios. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/dax-power-bi-add-measures/5-compare- calculated-columns-measures Option A is incorrect. Let\'s create a measure for EBITDA Margin to solve the same problem. Unlike for a calculated column, where we calculated an aggregation of ratios, the measure calculates a ratio (DIVIDE function) of the aggregation (SUM function) of EBITDA to the aggregation of Revenue. If we use calculated columns, the ratio is first calculated and then aggregated. With a measure, first, all the values are aggregated with the SUM function. Then the ratio is calculated. Doing so produces the correct result. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/dax-power-bi- add-measures/5-compare-calculated-columns-measures Option B is the correct answer. Custom columns are added in the Power Query Editor with M formula queries when loading the data. On the contrary, you create calculated columns in the Report or Data view of the Power BI model during design time. We use the same formula as the one used for the calculated column to create the custom column EBITDA margin. However, this solution is no different from using a calculated column. It will produce an incorrect result. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-add-custom- column Option C is incorrect.

The second parameter is the last value of the series 3. The third optional parameter is the incremental value. Option D is the correct answer as it creates a table that begins from 100 to 998, with increments of 2. Option C is incorrect as it includes a 4-digit even number (1000). Further, the incremental value cannot be negative, so this formula returns an error. Option B returns an empty table because the end value is less than the start value. If no incremental value is provided, the default value 1 is used. So, the formula in option A returns all numbers from 100 to 999. Check the PBIX file for the output.

Only paginated reports can display all records on separate pages. Detailed Explanation: When you export from Power BI reports/dashboards, Power BI captures a picture and exports only the data visible in the captured image. So, exporting a Power BI report with matrix visualization from the Power BI service will not display all the records in the PDF file. Option A is incorrect. Similar is the case with exporting a Power BI dashboard with a table visualization. Unlike for reports, there is no direct export as a PDF option for the dashboard. So, to export the dashboard as a PDF, go to File -> Print this page. Option B is also incorrect. Reference Link: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Desktop/How-to-Export- Dashboard-not-Report-in-PDF/td-p/2976684 The only way to export all the customer loyalty records to a PDF file is by creating a paginated report in the Power BI service. To create a paginated report, go to your workspace, and create a paginated report from the report\'s semantic model. On the paginated report, build the required visual (Loyalty No., Count of Loyalty No.). Once done, export the paginated report as PDF. We get all the loyalty records that span across multiple pages.
