    ],
    correct: ['B'],
    explanation: 'The benefits of using AWS SAM to create the serverless application include that it comes built-in with CodeDeploy to provide gradual Lambda deployments. With just a few lines of configuration, AWS SAM can perform the following actions: Deploys new versions of the Lambda function, and automatically creates aliases that point to the new version. Gradually shifts customer traffic to the new version until you\'re satisfied that it\'s working as expected, or you roll back the update. Defines pre-traffic and post- traffic test functions to verify that the newly deployed code is configured correctly, and your application operates as expected. Rolls back the deployment if CloudWatch alarms are triggered. The DevOps engineer can choose the Deployment Preference Type. The following options are available: Canary: Traffic is shifted in two increments. You can choose from predefined canary options. The options specify the percentage of traffic that\'s shifted to your updated Lambda function version in the first increment, and the interval, in minutes, before the remaining traffic is shifted in the second increment. Linear: Traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment. You can choose from predefined linear options that specify the percentage of traffic that\'s shifted in each increment and the number of minutes between each increment. All-at-once: All traffic is shifted from the original Lambda function to the updated Lambda function version at once. The best option to minimize the impact of failed deployments is to use the canary deployment type. This will ensure that only a small amount of traffic reaches the new Lambda function in the first shift and if any issues occur the deployment can be stopped. CORRECT: "Use an AWS SAM template to define the serverless application. Use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the Lambda functions with the Canary10Percent30Minutes deployment type" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy the serverless application. Use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the Lambda functions with the AllAtOnce deployment type. Monitor error rates using Amazon CloudWatch" is incorrect. The all-at-once deployment preference type would shift all traffic across to the new functions which would increase the impact of failed deployments. Also, CloudFormation is not a continuous deployment tool and is not a suitable substitute for CodePipeline and CodeDeploy. INCORRECT: "Use AWS CloudFor'

A lifecycle hook can be added on scale out/ scale in events and get signal back from EC2 instances. This is to make the load balancer aware when the instances are ready to serve traffic. A warm pool gives the ability to decrease latency for the applications that have exceptionally long boot times, for example, because instances need to write massive amounts of data to disk. With warm pools, Auto Scaling groups don\'t need to be over provisioned to manage latency and improve application performance. CORRECT: "Add a lifecycle hook to the Auto Scaling group, and to scale up quickly, utilize a warm pool" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Change the dynamic scaling policy to use a manual scaling policy and increase the pool size" is incorrect. This will increase the effort and cost of the solution.

Standby mode is useful when there\'s a specific issue within the instance that needs to be debugged and is not a regular practice.

INCORRECT: "Use AWS Systems Manager to automatically detect vulnerabilities on the EC2 instances.

Systems Manager Patch Manager can install patches to resolve vulnerabilities but does not provide automated detection of vulnerabilities.

INCORRECT: "Use AWS Systems Manager to automatically detect vulnerabilities on the EC2 instances.

This can be achieved through the pipeline configuration by specifying the runOrder to be the same for the build of each function within the action structure. To specify parallel actions, you use the same integer for each action you want to run in parallel. CORRECT: "Configure parallel executions of the Lambda functions by specifying the same runOrder in the CodePipeline configuration for the stage" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Configure the CodeBuild projects to run within a VPC and use dedicated instances to increase the build throughput" is incorrect. Connecting to a VPC does not help and using dedicated instances is not the best way to improve the speed of the pipeline. Without specifying other changes the builds will still run sequentially. INCORRECT: "Modify the CodeBuild projects within the pipeline to use a compute type with more available vCPUs" is incorrect.

This is because the information associated with their authenticated session was stored on the instance that has been terminated. The best way to ensure that users are not asked to reauthenticate in this situation is to store the data in a session store. Amazon ElastiCache is ideal for this use case as it stores key/value pairs and offers extremely low latency. The diagram below shows how you can use either DynamoDB or ElastiCache as a shared store for session state data: CORRECT: "Configure the application to store authenticated session information in an Amazon ElastiCache cluster" is the correct answer (as explained above.) INCORRECT: "Configure the application to store authenticated session information in an Amazon S3 bucket" is incorrect. Amazon S3 could be used in this situation but the latency would likely be higher compared to using Amazon ElastiCache. INCORRECT: "Enable sticky sessions on the target group and store authenticated session information on the instance\'s attached block volumes" is incorrect. Storing the data in the attached block volume is a bad idea as this would be deleted when the instance is terminated. INCORRECT: "Enable session affinity on the load balancer and store authenticated session information on the instance\'s attached block volumes" is incorrect. Stick sessions (also known as session affinity) is enabled at the target group, not at the load balancer level. Also, the session state data should not be stored on a block volume.

    explanation: 'Amazon CloudFront with Lambda@Edge - Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, which improves performance and reduces latency. Lambda@Edge runs your code in response to events generated by the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN). By combining Lambda@Edge with other AWS services, developers can build dynamic, powerful web applications at the edge that automatically scale up and down--with zero origin infrastructure and administrative effort required for automatic scaling, backups, or data center redundancy. By using Lambda@Edge to dynamically route requests to different origins based on different viewer characteristics, you can balance the load on your origins, while improving the performance for your users. For example, you can route requests to origins within a home region, based on a viewer\'s location. With Lambda@Edge, you don\'t have to provision or manage infrastructure in multiple locations around the world. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. Application Load Balancer - An Application Load Balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer. ALB offers support for Path conditions. You can configure rules for your listener that forward requests based on the URL in the request. This enables you to structure your application as smaller services, and route requests to the correct service based on the content of the URL.

You can create a stack set using the AWS Management Console or using AWS CloudFormation commands in the AWS CLI. You can create a stack set with either self-managed or service-managed permissions. With self-managed permissions, you can deploy stack instances to specific AWS accounts in specific Regions. To do this, you must first create the necessary IAM roles to establish a trusted relationship between the account you\'re administering the stack set from and the account you\'re deploying stack instances to.
