    explanation: 'Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it is protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures. Locally redundant storage (LRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but is not recommended for applications requiring high availability or durability.

You could add individual database-level IP firewall rules, but that is not the optimal solution. An NSG cannot help here, and the Azure Firewall service is more complicated to set up.

    explanation: 'Structured data, sometimes referred to as relational data, is data that adheres to a strict schema, so all of the data has the same fields or properties. The shared schema allows this type of data to be easily searched with query languages such as SQL (Structured Query Language). This capability makes this data style perfect for applications such as CRM systems, reservations, and inventory management. Structured data is often stored in database tables with rows and columns with key columns to indicate how one row in a table relates to data in another row of another table.

    correct: ['B'],
    explanation: 'Dynamic data masking (DDM) limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. It can be used to greatly simplify the design and coding of security in your application. Dynamic data masking helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to specify how much sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. DDM can be configured on designated database fields to hide sensitive data in the result sets of queries. With DDM the data in the database is not changed. DDM is easy to use with existing applications, since masking rules are applied in the query results. Many applications can mask sensitive data without modifying existing queries.

    explanation: 'By default, your Azure Cosmos account is accessible from internet, as long as the request is accompanied by a valid authorization token. To configure IP policy-based access control, the user must provide the set of IP addresses or IP address ranges in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) form to be included as the allowed list of client IPs to access a given Azure Cosmos account. Once this configuration is applied, any requests originating from machines outside this allowed list receive 403 (Forbidden) response.
