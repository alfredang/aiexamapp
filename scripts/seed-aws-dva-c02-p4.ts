    explanation: 'Correct option: "Cognito Identity Pools" Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token. Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services. Cognito Overview: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html Incorrect options: "Cognito User Pools" - AWS Cognito User Pools is there to authenticate users for your applications which looks similar to Cognito Identity Pools. The difference is that Identity Pools allows a way to authorize your users to use the various AWS services and User Pools is not about authorizing to AWS services but to provide add sign-up and sign-in functionality to web and mobile applications. "Cognito Sync" - You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend. The client libraries cache data locally so your app can read and write data regardless of device connectivity status. "IAM" - This is not a good solution because it would require you to have an IAM user for each mobile device which is not a good practice or manageable way of handling deployment. Exam Alert: Please review the following note to understand the differences between Cognito User Pools and Cognito Identity Pools: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html'

    explanation: 'Correct option: "Use a cron job on the instances that pushes the EC2 RAM statistics as a Custom metric into CloudWatch" The Amazon CloudWatch Monitoring Scripts for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux-based instances demonstrate how to produce and consume Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. These Perl scripts comprise a fully functional example that reports memory, swap, and disk space utilization metrics for a Linux instance. You can set a cron schedule for metrics reported to CloudWatch and report memory utilization to CloudWatch every x minutes. Incorrect options: "Extract RAM statistics using the instance metadata" - Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. Instance metadata is divided into categories, for example, hostname, events, and security groups. The instance metadata can only provide the ID of the RAM disk specified at launch time. So this option is incorrect. "Extract RAM statistics from the standard CloudWatch metrics for EC2 instances" - Amazon EC2 sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. By default, each data point covers the 5 minutes that follow the start time of activity for the instance. If you\'ve enabled detailed monitoring, each data point covers the next minute of activity from the start time. The standard CloudWatch metrics don\'t have any metrics for memory utilization details. "Extract RAM statistics using X-Ray" - AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your application\'s underlying components. How X-Ray Works: via - https://aws.amazon.com/xray/ X-Ray cannot be used to extract RAM statistics for EC2 instances.

Build data-intensive apps or boost the performance of your existing databases by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real- Time Analytics, and Queuing. To address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessed from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves. A common solution to for this is to leverage an In-Memory Key/Value store such as Redis and Memcached via ElastiCache. via - https://aws.amazon.com/caching/session-management/ Incorrect options: Use rolling updates instead of a blue/green deployment - With rolling deployments, Elastic Beanstalk splits the environment\'s Amazon EC2 instances into batches and deploys the new version of the application to one batch at a time. It leaves the rest of the instances in the environment running the old version of the application. When processing a batch, Elastic Beanstalk detaches all instances in the batch from the load balancer, deploys the new application version, and then reattaches the instances. This means that some of the users can experience session disruptions when the instances maintaining the sessions were detached as part of the given batch. So this option is incorrect. Enable sticky sessions in the Application Load Balancer - As the Application Load Balancer itself is replaced on each new deployment, so maintaining sticky sessions via the Application Load Balancer will not work. Use multicast to replicate session information - This option has been added as a distractor.

How IAM policy and SQS policy work in tandem: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-using-identity-based-policies.html If you add a policy that denies the user access to all actions for the queue, the policy will override the other two policies and the user will not have access to example_queue To remove the user\'s full access to the queue, the easiest thing to do is to add a policy that denies him access to all actions for the queue. This policy overrides the other two because an explicit deny always overrides an allow. You can also add an additional statement to the Amazon SQS policy that denies the user any type of access to the queue. It has the same effect as adding an IAM policy that denies the user access to the queue. How IAM policy and SQS policy work in tandem: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-using-identity-based-policies.html Incorrect options: If the user sends a SendMessage request to example_queue, the IAM policy will deny this action - If the user sends a SendMessage request to example_queue, the Amazon SQS policy allows the action. The IAM policy has no explicit deny on this action, so it plays no part. Either of IAM policies or Amazon SQS policies should be used to grant permissions. Both cannot be used together - There are two ways to give your users permissions to your Amazon SQS resources: using the Amazon SQS policy system and using the IAM policy system. You can use one or the other, or both. For the most part, you can achieve the same result with either one. Adding only an IAM policy to deny the user of all actions on the queue is not enough. The SQS policy should also explicitly deny all action - The user can be denied access using any one of the policies. Explicit deny in any policy will override all other allow actions defined using either of the policies.

Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials, you can delegate permission to make API requests using IAM roles. Amazon EC2 uses an instance profile as a container for an IAM role.

Kinesis Data Streams Overview: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/key-concepts.html For the given use-case, as the partition key is not distributed enough, all the data is getting skewed at a few specific shards and not leveraging the entire cluster of shards. You can also use metrics to determine which are your "hot" or "cold" shards, that is, shards that are receiving much more data, or much less data, than expected. You could then selectively split the hot shards to increase capacity for the hash keys that target those shards. Similarly, you could merge cold shards to make better use of their unused capacity. Incorrect options: Metrics are slow to update - Metrics are a CloudWatch concept. This option has been added as a distractor. You have too many shards - Too many shards is not the issue as you would see a LimitExceededException in that case. The data retention period is too long - Your streaming data is retained for up to 365 days. The data retention period is not an issue causing this error.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Use AWS KMS with automatic key rotation - Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. Amazon S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have three mutually exclusive options, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys: Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), Server-Side Encryption with Customer- Provided Keys (SSE-C). When you use server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), you can use the default AWS managed CMK, or you can specify a customer managed CMK that you have already created. If you don\'t specify a customer managed CMK, Amazon S3 automatically creates an AWS managed CMK in your AWS account the first time that you add an object encrypted with SSE-KMS to a bucket. By default, Amazon S3 uses this CMK for SSE-KMS. You can choose to have AWS KMS automatically rotate CMKs every year, provided that those keys were generated within AWS KMS HSMs. Incorrect options: Encrypt the data before sending it to Amazon S3 - The act of encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3 is called Client-Side encryption. You will have to handle the key generation, maintenance and rotation process. Hence, this is not the right choice here. Import a custom key into AWS KMS and automate the key rotation on an annual basis by using a Lambda function - When you import a custom key, you are responsible for maintaining a copy of your imported keys in your key management infrastructure so that you can re-import them at any time. Also, automatic key rotation is not supported for imported keys. Using Lambda functions to rotate keys is a possible solution, but not an optimal one for the current use case. Use SSE-C with automatic key rotation on an annual basis - With Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C), you manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption, as it writes to disks, and decryption, when you access your objects. The keys are not stored anywhere in Amazon S3. There is no automatic key rotation facility for this option. Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html'

After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action. One of many benefits of the Application Load Balancer is its support for path-based routing. You can configure rules for your listener that forward requests based on the URL in the request. This enables you to structure your application as smaller services, and route requests to the correct service based on the content of the URL. For needs relating to network traffic go with Network Load Balancer. Elastic Load Balancer - Elastic Load Balancing is the service itself that offers different types of load balancers.

If you are running microservices, you can route traffic to multiple back-end services using path-based routing. For example, you can route general requests to one target group and request to render images to another target group. This path-based routing allows you to route requests to, for example, /api to one set of servers (also known as target groups) and /mobile to another set. Segmenting your traffic in this way gives you the ability to control the processing environment for each category of requests. Perhaps /api requests are best processed on Compute Optimized instances, while /mobile requests are best handled by Memory Optimized instances. Host based You can create Application Load Balancer rules that route incoming traffic based on the domain name specified in the Host header. Requests to api.example.com can be sent to one target group, requests to mobile.example.com to another, and all others (by way of a default rule) can be sent to a third.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Use Git credentials generated from IAM - CodeCommit repositories are Git-based and support the basic functionalities of Git such as Git credentials. AWS recommends that you use an IAM user when working with CodeCommit. You can access CodeCommit with other identity types, but the other identity types are subject to limitations. The simplest way to set up connections to AWS CodeCommit repositories is to configure Git credentials for CodeCommit in the IAM console, and then use those credentials for HTTPS connections. You can also use these same credentials with any third-party tool or individual development environment (IDE) that supports HTTPS authentication using a static user name and password. An IAM user is an identity within your Amazon Web Services account that has specific custom permissions. For example, an IAM user can have permissions to create and manage Git credentials for accessing CodeCommit repositories. This is the recommended user type for working with CodeCommit. You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to secure AWS webpages like the AWS Management Console, AWS Discussion Forums, or the AWS Support Center. Authentication and access control for AWS CodeCommit: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control.html Incorrect options: Use IAM Multi-Factor authentication - AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your user name and password.

Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources. Use IAM user secret access key and access key ID - Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). As a best practice, AWS suggests using temporary security credentials (IAM roles) instead of access keys.

Amazon DynamoDB returns data to the application in 1 MB increments, and an application performs additional Scan operations to retrieve the next 1 MB of data. The larger the table or index being scanned, the more time the Scan takes to complete. To address these issues, the Scan operation can logically divide a table or secondary index into multiple segments, with multiple application workers scanning the segments in parallel. To make use of a parallel Scan feature, you will need to run multiple worker threads or processes in parallel. Each worker will be able to scan a separate partition of a table concurrently with the other workers. How DynamoDB parallel Scan works: via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.ParallelScan Incorrect options: Use a ProjectionExpression - A projection expression is a string that identifies the attributes you want.

For multiple attributes, the names must be comma-separated Use a FilterExpression - If you need to further refine the Scan results, you can optionally provide a filter expression. A filter expression determines which items within the Scan results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded. A filter expression is applied after a Scan finishes, but before the results are returned. Therefore, a Scan consumes the same amount of read capacity, regardless of whether a filter expression is present.

Using these event types, you can enable notification when an object is created using a specific API, or you can use the s3:ObjectCreated:* event type to request notification regardless of the API that was used to create an object. For the given use-case, you would create an S3 event notification that triggers a Lambda function whenever we have a PUT object operation in the S3 bucket. The Lambda function in turn would execute custom code to inserts records into DynamoDB. via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html Incorrect options: Write a cron job that will execute a Lambda function at a scheduled time and insert the records into DynamoDB - This is not efficient because there may not be any unprocessed file in the S3 bucket when the cron triggers the Lambda on schedule. So this is not the correct option. Set up an event with Amazon CloudWatch Events that will monitor the S3 bucket and then insert the records into DynamoDB - The CloudWatch event cannot directly insert records into DynamoDB as it\'s not a supported target type. The CloudWatch event needs to use something like a Lambda function to insert the records into DynamoDB. Develop a Lambda function that will poll the S3 bucket and then insert the records into DynamoDB - This is not efficient because there may not be any unprocessed file in the S3 bucket when the Lambda function polls the S3 bucket at a given time interval.

Incorrect options: While using Redis with cluster mode enabled, asynchronous replication mechanisms are used to keep the read replicas synchronized with the primary. If cluster mode is disabled, the replication mechanism is done synchronously - When you add a read replica to a cluster, all of the data from the primary is copied to the new node.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Use a Lambda function alias that can point to the different versions You can use versions to manage the deployment of your functions. For example, you can publish a new version of a function for beta testing without affecting users of the stable production version. Lambda creates a new version of your function each time that you publish the function. The new version is a copy of the unpublished version of the function. By publishing a version of your function, you can store your code and configuration as a separate resource that cannot be changed. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific function version. Users can access the function version using the alias Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Each alias has a unique ARN. An alias can point only to a function version, not to another alias. You can update an alias to point to the different versions of the Lambda function. Incorrect options: Use a Route 53 weighted policy that can point to the different Lambda function versions - This option is a distractor, as Route 53 cannot be used for the given use case. Route 53 weighted policy lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software. Use CodeDeploy to configure blue/green deployments for the different Lambda function versions - A deployment to the AWS Lambda compute platform is always a blue/green deployment. You do not specify a deployment type option. When you deploy to an AWS Lambda compute platform, the deployment configuration specifies the way traffic is shifted to the new Lambda function versions in your application. You can shift traffic using a canary, linear, or all-at-once deployment configuration. Once deployed, you cannot go back to the previous versions of your Lambda function. So this option is incorrect. Use Lambda function layers that can point to the different versions - Lambda layers provide a convenient way to package libraries and other dependencies that you can use with your Lambda functions. Using layers reduces the size of uploaded deployment archives and makes it faster to deploy your code. You cannot use the Lambda function layers to point to the different versions of the Lambda function.

AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications. CodeDeploy rolls back deployments by redeploying a previously deployed revision of an application as a new deployment. These rolled-back deployments are technically new deployments, with new deployment IDs, rather than restored versions of a previous deployment. To roll back an application to a previous revision, you just need to deploy that revision. AWS CodeDeploy keeps track of the files that were copied for the current revision and removes them before starting a new deployment, so there is no difference between redeploy and rollback. However, you need to make sure that the previous revisions are available for rollback.

Configure different Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues to receive these messages for downstream processing Amazon SNS works closely with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). These services provide different benefits for developers. Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a "push" mechanism, eliminating the need to periodically check or "poll" for updates. Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components-- without requiring each component to be concurrently available. Using Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS together, messages can be delivered to applications that require immediate notification of an event, and also stored in an Amazon SQS queue for other applications to process at a later time. When you subscribe an Amazon SQS queue to an Amazon SNS topic, you can publish a message to the topic and Amazon SNS sends an Amazon SQS message to the subscribed queue. The Amazon SQS message contains the subject and message that were published to the topic along with metadata about the message in a JSON document.

For the given scenario, we need a service that can store the message data pushed by SNS, for further processing. AWS Lambda does not have capacity to store the message data.

SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least- once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for several seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages. If you create a delay queue, any messages that you send to the queue remain invisible to consumers for the duration of the delay period. The default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes. via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay- queues.html Incorrect options: Implement application-side delay - You can customize your application to delay sending messages but it is not a robust solution. You can run into a scenario where your application crashes before sending a message, then that message would be lost. Use visibility timeout parameter - Visibility timeout is a period during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing a given message.

You cannot use visibility timeout to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds. Enable LongPolling - Long polling makes it inexpensive to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queue as soon as the messages are available.

When the wait time for the ReceiveMessage API action is greater than 0, long polling is in effect. The maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds.

In fact, they are costlier than standard queues. Decrease DelaySeconds - This is similar to VisibilityTimeout.

    explanation: 'Correct option: SNS + SQS Amazon SNS enables message filtering and fanout to a large number of subscribers, including serverless functions, queues, and distributed systems. Additionally, Amazon SNS fans out notifications to end users via mobile push messages, SMS, and email. How SNS Works: via - https://aws.amazon.com/sns/ Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best- effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. Because each buffered request can be processed independently, Amazon SQS can scale transparently to handle the load without any provisioning instructions from you. SNS and SQS can be used to create a fanout messaging scenario in which messages are "pushed" to multiple subscribers, which eliminates the need to periodically check or poll for updates and enables parallel asynchronous processing of the message by the subscribers. SQS can allow for later re-processing and dead letter queues. This is called the fan-out pattern. Incorrect options: SNS + Kinesis - You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process large streams of data records in real-time. Kinesis Data Streams stores records from 24 hours (by default) to 8760 hours (365 days). However, you need to manually provision shards in case the load increases or you need to use CloudWatch alarms to set up auto scaling for the shards. Since Kinesis only supports transparent scaling in the on-demand mode, however, it is not cost efficient for the given use case, so this option is not the right fit for the given use case. SNS + Lambda - Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda are integrated so you can invoke Lambda functions with Amazon SNS notifications. The Lambda function receives the message payload as an input parameter and can manipulate the information in the message, publish the message to other SNS topics, or send the message to other AWS services. However, your EC2 instances cannot "poll" from Lambda functions and as such, this would not work. SQS + SES - This will not work as the messages need to be processed twice (once for sending the notification and later for order fulfillment) and SQS only allows for one consuming application.

You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC. When you create a custom Network ACL and associate it with a subnet, by default, this custom Network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules. A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic. Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa). The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range varies depending on the client\'s operating system. Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535. List of ephemeral port ranges: Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon Linux kernel) use ports 32768-61000.

When used in conjunction with any database including Amazon RDS or Amazon DynamoDB, ElastiCache can alleviate the pressure associated with heavy request loads, increase overall application performance and reduce costs associated with scaling for throughput on other databases. Amazon ElastiCache makes it easy to deploy and manage a highly available and scalable in-memory data store in the cloud. Among the open source in-memory engines available for use with ElastiCache is Redis, which added powerful geospatial capabilities in its newer versions. You can leverage ElastiCache for Redis with cluster mode enabled to enhance reliability and availability with little change to your existing workload. Cluster Mode comes with the primary benefit of horizontal scaling up and down of your Redis cluster, with almost zero impact on the performance of the cluster. Enabling Cluster Mode provides a number of additional benefits in scaling your cluster. In short, it allows you to scale in or out the number of shards (horizontal scaling) versus scaling up or down the node type (vertical scaling). This means that Cluster Mode can scale to very large amounts of storage (potentially 100s of terabytes) across up to 90 shards, whereas a single node can only store as much data in memory as the instance type has capacity for. Cluster Mode also allows for more flexibility when designing new workloads with unknown storage requirements or heavy write activity. In a read-heavy workload, one can scale a single shard by adding read replicas, up to five, but a write-heavy workload can benefit from additional write endpoints when cluster mode is enabled.

Use them the same way as you would a parameter, as the argument for the Ref function. You can access pseudo parameters in a CloudFormation template like so: Outputs: MyStacksRegion: Value: !Ref "AWS::Region" The AWS::Region pseudo parameter returns a string representing the Region in which the encompassing resource is being created, such as us-west-2. Incorrect options: Create a CloudFormation parameter for Region and let the desired value be populated at the time of deployment - Although it is certainly possible to use a CloudFormation parameter to populate the desired value of the Region at the time of deployment, however, this is not operationally efficient, as you can directly use the AWS::Region pseudo parameter for this. Set up a mapping containing the key and the named values for all AWS Regions and then have the CloudFormation template auto-select the desired value - The Mappings section matches a key to a corresponding set of named values. For example, if you want to set values based on a Region, you can create a mapping that uses the Region name as a key and contains the values you want to specify for each specific Region. You use the Fn::FindInMap intrinsic function to retrieve values in a map. This option is incorrect as the CloudFormation template cannot auto-select the desired value of the Region from a mapping. Create an AWS Lambda-backed custom resource for Region and let the desired value be populated at the time of deployment by the Lambda - Custom resources enable you to write custom provisioning logic in templates that AWS CloudFormation runs anytime you create, update (if you changed the custom resource), or delete stacks. When you associate a Lambda function with a custom resource, the function is invoked whenever the custom resource is created, updated, or deleted. This option is a distractor, as Region is not a custom resource that needs to be provisioned.

Due to recent hacking attempts, security measures have become stricter and require you to store data in encrypted queues.

    explanation: 'Correct option: Enable SQS KMS encryption Server-side encryption (SSE) lets you transmit sensitive data in encrypted queues. SSE protects the contents of messages in queues using keys managed in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). AWS KMS combines secure, highly available hardware and software to provide a key management system scaled for the cloud. When you use Amazon SQS with AWS KMS, the data keys that encrypt your message data are also encrypted and stored with the data they protect. You can choose to have SQS encrypt messages stored in both Standard and FIFO queues using an encryption key provided by AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Incorrect options: Use the SSL endpoint - The given use-case needs encryption at rest. When using SSL, the data is encrypted during transit, but the data needs to be encrypted at rest as well, so this option is incorrect. Use Client-side encryption - For additional security, you can build your application to encrypt messages before they are placed in a message queue but will require a code change, so this option is incorrect. *Use Secrets Manager * - AWS Secrets Manager enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets with a call to Secrets Manager APIs, eliminating the need to hardcode sensitive information in plain text. Secrets Manager offers secret rotation with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DocumentDB. Secrets Manager cannot be used for encrypting data at rest.
