    stem: 'You generate invoices for orders placed by customers to procure specific quantities of raw material for their business. From the invoice details in the Purchase table, you need to find the lowest Order Quantity value for any order each month. Which of the following DAX formulas can you use? Select two options. Note: [Total Order Quantity] =SUM ( \'Purchase\'[Ordered Quantity] )',

    ],
    correct: ['A', 'C'],
    explanation: 'Since the DAX formulas evaluate the Lowest Order Quantity value each month, we can safely assume that year and month are in the filter context. That is year and month filter the table before the evaluation of these DAX formulas. Before we deep dive, appreciate that MINX is an iterator function. That is, these functions evaluate the expression in row context. In other words, they evaluate the expression (2nd parameter) for each row of a table (1st parameter). Reference Link: https://dax.guide/minx/ The DAX formula in option A works as below to fetch the correct result. 1. The filter context [example, month: January and year: 2013] filters the Purchases table. 2. Since the DAX formula invokes the measure [Total Order Quantity], the DAX engine automatically wraps the measure with a CALCULATE function. 3. The presence of CALCULATE function in a row context means that context transition is automatic. So the CALCULATE function adds the row values (Example: [Purchase Key] = 312) to the filter context and filters the table. 4. The DAX engine evaluates the measure [Total Order Quantity] only for that specific row ([Purchase Key] = 312). The result of summing a single value is the same value (12). 5. The above steps 3 & 4 repeats for every row where year = 2013 and month = Jan. Finally, MINX returns the minimum value of all the results, which is (6). Option A is one of the correct answers. In option B, there is no measure or CALCULATE function in row context (2nd parameter of MINX function). So, the row values do not filter the column. 1. This means for every row in the Purchases table, SUM expression evaluates to return the total of all the Order Quantities (for year = 2013 and month = January). 2. The MINX DAX function returns the minimum value of all the computed values, which is 33. Note: To explain the inner workings, I have taken sample data in the example table. So, the output shown below is different from the real dataset. Note that this DAX formula computes the total order quantities for a month, not the lowest order quantity value each month. In the Power BI matrix visual (left above), note that both the columns display the same total value. So, option B is incorrect. In option C, too, we have the CALCULATE function. 1. This means the context transition is automatic. The row value ([Purchase Key] = 312) filters the table for the first row. 2. So, MAX ( \'Purchase\'[Ordered Quantity] ) returns 12 for the first row. The Max of a single value is the same value.'

If you have skipped that, read the detailed explanation for that question before proceeding. Almost 95% of the explanation is similar. Since this question asks the sum of the highest three sales transactions for each product, we need to sort the Sales table in the descending order of the Sales Amount value. So, the only change required is in the order_by expression (3rd parameter) of the TOPN function. Note: In the TOPN function, I have omitted the 4th parameter order. So, by default, it sorts the order in the descending order of Sales Amount. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/topn-function-dax The above formula gives us the measure Sum of the highest three sales transactions.

In the sample data, the Occurred At column values are in the format yyyy-mm-dd at hh:mm:ss and not yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss. The presence of the text at prevents Power BI to automatically convert the column\'s data type from text to Date/Time. Manually converting the column\'s data type from text to the Date datatype would result in an error. And, this is the error message we get: Option Extract the first 11 characters of the Occurred At column using the Extract transform is also an incorrect choice. Although the Extract transform lets you extract the first 11 characters, it throws away the remaining characters in the Occurred At column. So, the Time data will be lost. Since we may need to analyze the event data every hour in the future, it is essential to retain Time information in the data model. Option Split the Occurred At column by first 11 characters using the Split transform is the correct answer. You can use the split transform to split the Occurred At column by the first 11 characters. A new column is created with the Date values (which you can use to analyze the maintenance events). And, the rest of the text (including Time values) is preserved too (which you can use to analyze the event data every hour).

    explanation: 'The filter propagates from Dim Geo -> Dim Reseller -> Fact Reseller Sales because for One-to-many/Many-to- one relationships, if the Cross filter direction is single, the direction of the filter is always from the one-side. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-relationships-understand#cross-filter-direction We can infer that the Sales Territory Key values are unique in the Dim Territory table (as Dim Territory is a dimension table, it needs to have at least one unique identifier). So, Dim Territory is on the one-side of the relationship. In the Dim Geo table, the Geography Key is the primary key, and the Sales Territory Key is the foreign key. So, the Dim Geo and Dim Territory tables are related by the Sales Territory Key. When we try to create a relationship (drag Sales Territory Key from one table to the other), it creates a Many-to-one relationship. Note that the filter runs from Dim Territory to Dim Geo. Any filters applied to the Dim Territory table is carried all the way through to the Fact Reseller Sales table (as all the filter directions are aligned). Option Area 1: Many to one, Area 2: Single is the correct answer. Option Area 1: Many to one, Area 2: Both is incorrect. There is no need to have a bidirectional filter between Dim Geo and Dim Territory tables if the requirement is satisfied with a single directional filter. You should use a bidirectional filter only in some specific scenarios (see the below link). Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/relationships-bidirectional- filtering Option Area 1: Many to Many, Area 2: Single is incorrect too. The dimension table Dim Sales Territory doesn\'t have duplicate values (which is required for a Many-to-many relationship). Finally, the option Area 1: One-to-one, Area 2: Single itself is incorrect as all One-to-one relationships have bidirectional cross filters (not Single-directional filters).

Reference Link: https://i1.wp.com/radacad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/untitled.png The option Line chart is incorrect. While you can compare the trends of Units Sold for each product over time, they are not great at understanding part-to-whole relationships. An area chart is similar to a line chart except, they fill the area below the Units Sold line. Area charts work well with two or three different categories (products).

Reference Link: https://rockcontent.com/blog/line-vs-area-charts/ To solve this problem, we can stack the categories on top of one another, which is exactly what a stacked area chart does. But with a stacked area chart, the raw values are stacked to show how the composition of products changes over time. Since the sales managers need to visualize the percentage (not real values) of Units Sold for each of their products, the option Stacked area chart is incorrect. So, that leaves us with a 100% stacked area chart. In this type of chart, we display the percentage values rather than real values.

    explanation: 'While importing the data in Power Query, you can remove the card PIN column if you do not plan to expose the data in reports. This is the best solution that will optimize (decrease) the Power BI model size. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en- us/power-query/choose-remove-columns#remove-selected-columns Option B is the correct answer. All the other options hide the column from the report user. But since they do not remove the column from the model, they do not optimize the model size. You can implement masking by creating a new column Masked PIN in Power Query & using the RandomBetween function to generate masked PIN numbers between 1000 and 9999. Even if we delete the original Card PIN column, the model size does not decrease (remains the same) as this solution creates an additional column. Reference Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmWD7Ayw_NI So, option A is incorrect. Hiding the card PIN column in the model view only hides the column from the report view. The column is still loaded in the model, so this solution does not optimize the model size. Option C is incorrect. Object-level security locks down the column for a particular role. For example, we can create a role (HidePIN) in Power BI Desktop and change the object-level security of the Card PIN column for the role HidePIN from default to none in tabular editor. When users with the HidePIN role logs in, they will not see the Card PIN column. This solution only restricts access to the column and it doesn\'t decrease the model size.

Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform- model/dataflows/dataflows-introduction-self-service Option B is the correct choice. In an organization, different applications may keep track of same entities. For example, the Sales team may have Patient data. So is the immunology team. Common Data Model provides a standard template structure to integrate the patient data across different systems. CDM may sound similar to dataflows. Common Data Model defines the standardized schema for an entity across an industry. Dataflows is an ETL tool that enables you to build standardized tables for your organization. Reference Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/ Option C is incorrect. Using shared datasets, you can define standardized data models that can be reused (shared) by several teams. These data models contain calculations like measures, and calculated columns, in addition to data and relationships. Only dataflows help create reusable standardized dimensions/tables. Reference Link: https://radacad.com/power-bi-shared-datasets-what-is-it-how-does-it-work-and-why-should-you-care Option A is incorrect.

The word cloud visual has three wells: Category, Values, and Excludes. Very obviously, the US State name will go to the Category well. And the population field (numerical) will go to the Values well. So, Values -> Population. By default, the visual\'s Word-breaking is enabled. This is fine if we need to count the frequency of a particular text. But to display the entire US state name, we need to disable it. This ensures that states that have two or more words are displayed as a single text. E.g., New York.

    explanation: 'Summary for Revision: If you categorize geographic fields, Power BI provides geographic filters in mobile apps to match the user\'s location. Users can then select the filters to view only the relevant data (for the location). Detailed Explanation: From the Power BI Desktop table view, you can categorize geographic fields and publish the report. When the user accesses the report in Power BI mobile apps, Power BI automatically provides geographical filters to match the user\'s location. For example, I am accessing the below report from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Selecting "Only Tamil Nadu" will display records only for the cities within the Tamil Nadu state (Chennai, Coimbatore, and Madurai). So, when Sam lands in the Tamil Nadu state, his Power BI mobile app displays only the records of all cities in Tamil Nadu. Reference Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-mobile-geofiltering https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power- bi/consumer/mobile/mobile-apps-geographic-filtering Option D is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect. Adding latitude and longitude columns will not filter the report when accessed using mobile apps. Data categorization should be complete before Power BI could provide geographic filters. Option B is incorrect. Converting the table/matrix visual to a map/filled map visual provides a visually pleasing way to analyze data by geographies. But if the data is not categorized, the mobile app report will not even display the geo filter for selection. Option C is incorrect. RLS enables you to apply security filters at the data level. So, if Sam creates RLS roles for a specific State, and assigns them to himself, the report will display the same records irrespective of his location. RLS isn\'t aware of the user\'s location.
