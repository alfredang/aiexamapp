    explanation: 'The most effective approach for Sanjay is to create a milestone and add the related issues to it. Milestones in GitHub are designed for grouping and tracking related issues, making it efficient for tracking and reporting purposes. ******************** WRONG ANSWERS: While labels can help categorize issues, creating individual labels for each issue might become unwieldy and is not the most efficient approach for tracking a group of related issues. GitHub Discussions are not primarily designed for tracking issues. They are threaded conversations for collaboration. Assigning access permissions to team members is not the primary solution for efficiently tracking and reporting on related issues. https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track- work/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests'

This provides more options to customize the project boards and workflows for issues, pull requests, and much more. Some examples of these external tools and services include GraphQL API and Github Actions. ******************** WRONG ANSWERS: Projects Classic does have more extensive integration options. Projects Classic provides a more basic approach towards projects with a simpler user interface. The more basic approach limits the integrations in Project Classic Projects and Projects Classic do not provide the same integration capabilities. As stated before, Projects is more complex and provides more integration with external tools, and Projects Classic provide a more basic approach with less integration options Both Projects and Projects Classic provide integration features with external tools and services.

    explanation: 'You can protect important branches by setting branch protection rules, which define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks, a linear commit history or the number of approving reviews. **************** WRONG ANSWERS: Branch protection is not designed to restrict the number of commits but to safeguard branches from unintended changes. Branch protection itself does not enforce two-factor authentication. Authentication methods are configured at the user or organization level on GitHub. Branch protection does not have the capability to automatically quarantine branches based on code analysis.

You can generate two types of chart: current charts and historical charts. You can create current charts to visualize your project items.

The sequence git init, git commit, git branch, git add is incorrect as git init initializes a new Git repository but is not part of the process of adding new files.

If push protection is enabled, also detects secrets when they are pushed to your repository. Dependency review - Show the full impact of changes to dependencies and see details of any vulnerable versions before you merge a pull request **************** WRONG ANSWERS: GitHub has many features that help you improve and maintain the quality of your code.

    correct: ['D', 'E'],
    explanation: 'You can use Projects to manage your work on GitHub, where your issues and pull requests live. Breaking a large issue into smaller issues makes the work more manageable and enables team members to work in parallel. It also leads to smaller pull requests, which are easier to review. Issues and pull requests include built-in features to let you easily communicate with your collaborators. Use @mentions to alert a person or entire team about a comment. Assign collaborators to issues to communicate responsibility. Link to related issues or pull requests to communicate how they are connected. Use your project\'s description and README to share information about the project. For example: Explaining the purpose of the project. Describing the project views and how to use them. Including relevant links and people to contact for more information. Project READMEs support Markdown which allows you to use images and advanced formatting such as links, lists, and headers. To prevent information from getting out of sync, maintain a single source of truth. For example, track a target ship date in a single location instead of spread across multiple fields. Then, if the target ship date shifts, you only need to update the date in one location. Use an iteration field to schedule work or create a timeline. You can group by iteration to see if items are balanced between iterations, or you can filter to focus on a single iteration. Iteration fields also let you view work that you completed in past iterations, which can help with velocity planning and reflecting on your team\'s accomplishments. ******************** WRONG ANSWER: You can automate tasks to spend less time on busy work and more time on the project itself. The less you need to remember to do manually, the more likely your project will stay up to date. https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about- projects/best-practices-for-projects'

    explanation: 'You can manage collaborators by accessing the repository settings on GitHub. This allows you to add or remove collaborators, define their permissions, and control access to the repository. **************** WRONG ANSWERS: While you can add collaborators, invitations are usually sent through GitHub, not via email. GitHub provides a user interface for adding collaborators in the repository settings. Managing collaborators does not require creating separate repositories for each collaborator. Collaborator permissions are set at the repository level. Sharing a link to the code repository is not a correct method for inviting collaborators on GitHub because simply sharing the link does not grant the necessary access or permissions for someone to collaborate effectively. https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and- features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your- repository'

    explanation: 'An organization\'s news feed shows other people\'s activity on repositories owned by that organization. You can use your organization\'s news feed to see when someone opens, closes, or merges an issue or pull request, creates or deletes a bran, creates a tag or release, comments on an open issue, pull request, or commit, or pushes new commits to GitHub. **************** WRONG ANSWERS: GitHub notifications primarily focus on providing updates related to activities and events that involve the user\'s account, such as mentions, comments, or pull request updates. While notifications can include information about repository activity, they are not the primary feature for obtaining an organization-wide overview of recent activity. The organization news feed is more suitable for this purpose, offering a centralized view of events across multiple repositories in the organization. Repository insights is a feature that provides analytics and visualizations related to a specific repository\'s activity, such as traffic and contributor statistics. However, it is not designed to offer an organization- wide overview of recent activity across multiple repositories. GitHub Issues is a tracking system for managing and discussing tasks, enhancements, bugs, and other issues within a specific repository. While it is an essential tool for collaboration within a repository, it is not a feature designed to provide an organization-wide overview of recent activity. https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in- organizations/about-your-organizations-news-feed'

    explanation: 'To make it easier for people to understand and navigate your work, we recommend that you create a README file for every repository. GitHub recommends that regular collaborators work from a single repository to streamline collaboration, creating pull requests between branches instead of between repositories. Forking is best suited for accepting contributions from people who are unaffiliated with a project, such as open-source contributors. To optimize performance, GitHub.com limits the sizes of files allowed in repositories. To track large files in a Git repository, GitHub recommends using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS). ****************** WRONG ANSWER: it\'s generally not recommended to delete commit history in a code repository unless sensitive information was accidentally added to a commit https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/best- practices-for-repositories'
