A self-service report, also known as an on-demand report, is one that is run directly by the consumer.

A high p- value indicates that the outcome is likely not repeatable and thus not significant and a low p- value indicates that the event is likely repeatable and thus statistically significant. A t-test is used when comparing two groups to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of both groups. N count is the amount of data being used in research.

Extract Load Transform (ETL) is a more modern method that is used when preparing data for data lakes. A full load is an act of loading all data from a source system for the first time.

Pearson\'s correlation coefficient is a calculation used to measure a linear relationship between data points and returns an r value that is plus or minus 1 to determine the strength of the relationship. A casual relationship proves that a variable has an effect on another variable. Correlation is the statistical association between two or more equal variables.

Each bin is placed on the x-axis with the y-axis holding the assessed value. A line graph, or run chart, uses a single horizontal line or a group of multiple lines to represent different data points at different times. This is typically used when an analyst wants to display time-series data, or data over intervals of time because the connected line makes it easier to see how that data changes over time. The stacked column/bar chart breaks a bar or column into separate portions to represent each data point. A scatter plot consists of two variables plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, with a dot placed on the graph where the two data points converge on both of the axes. Scatter plots help analysts determine if there is a relationship between the two variables placed on the axes, and are especially useful to spot outliers in a data set.'

A chi-square statistic compares the size of the difference between an expected result and the actual result. This measures how a model compares to the actual data. Both a goodness of fit and a test of independence are chi-square tests. A goodness of fit tests a single variable and the test of independence is used to test multiple variables.'
