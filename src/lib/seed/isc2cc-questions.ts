/**
 * ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) bundle seed — vendor, three
 * practice-exam variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions.
 * Idempotent: replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:isc2cc-seed'`
 * and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedIsc2Cc(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/isc2cc.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-isc2cc`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is original, scenario-based, and authored against the
 * public ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) Exam Outline and
 * foundational security concepts (NIST, ISC2 study material). These are
 * NOT real exam items and make no claim to mirror live exam content.
 * Blueprint domain weighting:
 *   - Security Principles                                          — 26% (17/65)
 *   - Access Controls Concepts                                     — 22% (14/65)
 *   - Network Security                                             — 24% (16/65)
 *   - Security Operations                                          — 18% (12/65)
 *   - Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery and Incident Response  — 10% (6/65)
