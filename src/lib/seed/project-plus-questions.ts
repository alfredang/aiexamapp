/**
 * CompTIA Project+ (PK0-005) bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam
 * variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent:
 * replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:project-plus-seed'` and
 * upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedProjectPlus(db)` so the same code path is reachable
 * from the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/project-plus.ts`) and the
 * protected admin API (`/api/admin/seed-project-plus`) — letting us
 * bootstrap the production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public CompTIA Project+
 * (PK0-005) exam objectives and standard project-management practice
 * (PMI/PMBOK, predictive/agile/hybrid delivery):
