/**
 * ISC2 SSCP bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:sscp-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedSscp(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/sscp.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-sscp`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public ISC2 Systems Security
 * Certified Practitioner (SSCP) Exam Outline and standard operational
 * security practice (NIST SP 800-series, CISA). These are original,
 * scenario-based items — not real exam questions or braindumps.
 *
 *   - Security Operations and Administration              — 16% (10)
 *   - Access Controls                                     — 15% (10)
