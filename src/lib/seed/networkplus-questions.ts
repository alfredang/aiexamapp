/**
 * CompTIA Network+ (N10-009) bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam
 * variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent:
 * replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:networkplus-seed'` and
 * upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedNetworkPlus(db)` so the same code path is reachable
 * from the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/networkplus.ts`) and the
 * protected admin API (`/api/admin/seed-networkplus`) — letting us
 * bootstrap the production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public CompTIA Network+
 * (N10-009) exam objectives and authoritative RFC / vendor docs:
