/**
 * CompTIA SecurityX (CASP+, CAS-005) bundle seed — vendor, three
 * practice-exam variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions.
 * Idempotent: replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:securityx-seed'`
 * and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedSecurityX(db)` so the same code path is reachable
 * from the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/securityx.ts`) and the
 * protected admin API (`/api/admin/seed-securityx`) — letting us
 * bootstrap the production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public CompTIA SecurityX
 * (CAS-005) exam objectives and enterprise security architecture /
 * engineering practice:
 *   - Governance, Risk, and Compliance  — 20% (13 / 65)
 *   - Security Architecture             — 27% (18 / 65)
 *   - Security Engineering              — 31% (20 / 65)
 *   - Security Operations               — 22% (14 / 65)
 *
 * These are original advanced scenario items written to the objective
 * domains; they are NOT real exam questions and make no such claim.
