/**
 * Cisco DevNet Associate (200-901 DEVASC) bundle seed — vendor, three
 * practice-exam variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions.
 * Idempotent: replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:devnet-seed'`
 * and upserts the catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedDevnet(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/devnet.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-devnet`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Cisco DevNet docs and
 * the official Cisco 200-901 DEVASC exam-topics blueprint:
 *   - Software Development and Design        — 15% (10/variant)
 *   - Understanding and Using APIs           — 20% (13/variant)
 *   - Cisco Platforms and Development        — 15% (10/variant)
 *   - Application Deployment and Security    — 15% (10/variant)
 *   - Infrastructure and Automation          — 20% (13/variant)
 *   - Network Fundamentals                   — 15% ( 9/variant)
 *
 * These are original scenario-based items grounded in the published
 * exam topics — they are NOT copied from any real exam and make no
 * claim of being actual exam content.
