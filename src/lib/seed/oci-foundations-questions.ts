/**
 * OCI Foundations bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants,
 * bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:oci-foundations-seed'` and upserts catalog
 * rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedOciFoundations(db)` so the same code path is reachable
 * from the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/oci-foundations.ts`) and the
 * protected admin API (`/api/admin/seed-oci-foundations`) — letting us
 * bootstrap the production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Oracle Cloud
 * Infrastructure documentation (docs.oracle.com) and the official
 * Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate (1Z0-1085) exam
 * objectives:
 *   - OCI Introduction                  — 15% (10/variant)
 *   - OCI Identity and Access Management — 20% (13/variant)
 *   - Networking                        — 20% (13/variant)
 *   - Compute                           — 15% (10/variant)
