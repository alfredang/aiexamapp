/**
 * PMI-ACP bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:pmiacp-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedPmiAcp(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/pmiacp.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-pmiacp`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is original, scenario-based, and authored against the
 * public PMI-ACP exam content outline and standard agile / Scrum / Kanban
 * / Lean / XP practice. These are practice items only — they are not
 * copied from, and do not reproduce, any real PMI exam.
 *
 * PMI-ACP domain blueprint (sum 100):
 *   - Agile Principles and Mindset            — 16 (10 per 65-q variant)
 *   - Value-Driven Delivery                   — 20 (13)
 *   - Stakeholder Engagement                  — 17 (11)
 *   - Team Performance                        — 16 (10)
