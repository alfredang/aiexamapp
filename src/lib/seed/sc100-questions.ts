/**
 * SC-100 bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:sc100-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedSc100(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/sc100.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-sc100`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Microsoft Learn
 * SC-100 study guide, the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference
 * Architectures (MCRA), and the Zero Trust guidance. Each variant has
 * 65 questions blueprint-weighted to the official SC-100 domains:
 *   - Design Solutions That Align with Security Best Practices
 *     and Priorities                                            — 24% (16)
 *   - Design Security Operations, Identity, and Compliance
 *     Capabilities                                              — 27% (17)
 *   - Design Security Solutions for Infrastructure              — 23% (15)
 *   - Design Security Solutions for Applications and Data       — 26% (17)
