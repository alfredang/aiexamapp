/**
 * AI-900 bundle seed — vendor (Microsoft), three practice-exam variants,
 * bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions.
 *
 * Unlike most other seeds, this one performs a FULL wipe of the exam's
 * question pool on every run (not filtered by `generatedBy`) because the
 * production pool was heavily skewed toward one domain (~154 ML out of 360)
 * and needs to be replaced wholesale with this blueprint-weighted set.
 *
 * Exported as `seedAi900(db)` so the same code path is reachable from the
 * standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/ai900.ts`) and the protected admin
 * API (`/api/admin/seed-ai900`) — letting us bootstrap the production
 * database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Microsoft Learn docs
 * and the Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) domain blueprint:
 *   - Describe Artificial Intelligence workloads and considerations        — 18% (12 per variant)
 *   - Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure          — 18% (12 per variant)
 *   - Describe features of computer vision workloads on Azure               — 18% (12 per variant)
 *   - Describe features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads      — 18% (12 per variant)
 *   - Describe features of generative AI workloads on Azure                 — 28% (17 per variant)
 *
 * These are original, scenario-based study questions — they are not copies
 * of any live Microsoft exam and make no claim to be the real
 * certification exam.
