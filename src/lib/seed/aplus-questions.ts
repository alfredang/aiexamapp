/**
 * CompTIA A+ bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions (65 per variant). Idempotent:
 * replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:aplus-seed'` and upserts
 * catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedAplus(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/aplus.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-aplus`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public CompTIA A+ exam
 * objectives (220-1101 Core 1 + 220-1102 Core 2) and authoritative
 * vendor documentation. Domain blueprint (sums to 100):
 *   - Hardware                                       — 18% (12)
 *   - Networking                                     — 17% (11)
 *   - Mobile Devices and Virtualization              — 13% (8)
 *   - Operating Systems                              — 18% (12)
 *   - Security                                       — 18% (12)
 *   - Software and Operational Troubleshooting       — 16% (10)
 *
 * These are original study questions inspired by the published exam
 * objectives; they are NOT real or official CompTIA exam items.
