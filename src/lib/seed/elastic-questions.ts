/**
 * Elastic Certified Engineer bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam
 * variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent:
 * replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:elastic-seed'` and upserts
 * catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedElastic(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/elastic.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-elastic`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Elasticsearch 8.x
 * reference documentation and the Elastic Certified Engineer exam
 * objective areas:
 *   - Installation and Configuration            — 20% (4)
 *   - Indexing Data                             — 20% (4)
