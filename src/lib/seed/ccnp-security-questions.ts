/**
 * Cisco CCNP Security (SCOR 350-701) bundle seed — vendor, three
 * practice-exam variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions.
 * Idempotent: replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:ccnp-security-seed'`
 * and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedCcnpSecurity(db)` so the same code path is reachable
 * from the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/ccnp-security.ts`) and the
 * protected admin API (`/api/admin/seed-ccnp-security`) — letting us
 * bootstrap the production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Cisco SCOR 350-701
 * exam topics and Cisco security product documentation (ISE, Firepower/
 * FTD, Umbrella, ESA/WSA, AnyConnect, Stealthwatch). It is NOT a
 * braindump and never claims to be the real certification exam. Domain
 * blueprint (sum 100):
 *   - Security Concepts                                            — 25% (16/variant)
 *   - Network Security                                             — 20% (13/variant)
 *   - Securing the Cloud                                           — 15% (10/variant)
 *   - Content Security                                             — 15% (10/variant)
 *   - Endpoint Protection and Detection                            — 10% (7/variant)
