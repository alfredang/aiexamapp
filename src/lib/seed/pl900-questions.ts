/**
 * PL-900 bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:pl900-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedPl900(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/pl900.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-pl900`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Microsoft Learn
 * PL-900 study guide and Power Platform documentation, and the
 * Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals (PL-900) domain blueprint:
 *   - Describe the Business Value of Power Platform                 — 20% (13)
 *   - Identify Core Components of Power Platform                     — 20% (13)
 *   - Demonstrate the Capabilities of Power Apps                     — 15% (10)
 *   - Demonstrate the Capabilities of Power Automate                 — 15% (10)
 *   - Demonstrate the Capabilities of Power BI                       — 15% (10)
 *   - Demonstrate the Capabilities of Power Pages and Copilot Studio — 15% (9)
 *
 * These are original, scenario-based study questions — they are not
 * copies of any live Microsoft exam and make no claim to be the real
 * certification exam.
