/**
 * SC-300 bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:sc300-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedSc300(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/sc300.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-sc300`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Microsoft Learn
 * SC-300 study guide and Microsoft Entra ID documentation, mapped to
 * the Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator (SC-300) domains:
 *   - Implement Identities in Microsoft Entra            — 20% (13)
 *   - Implement Authentication and Access Management      — 30% (19)
 *   - Implement Access Management for Applications        — 15% (10)
 *   - Plan and Implement Identity Governance              — 35% (23)
 *
 * These are original scenario-based items written to teach the
 * objectives — they are not transcribed from any live exam and the
 * product never claims to reproduce real exam questions.
