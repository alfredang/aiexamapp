/**
 * ISC2 CCSP bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:ccsp-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedCcsp(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/ccsp.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-ccsp`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public ISC2 CCSP exam
 * outline, NIST cloud guidance, and CSA guidance. Domain blueprint
 * (CCSP, six domains, sums to 100):
 *   - Cloud Concepts, Architecture and Design        — 17% (11/65)
 *   - Cloud Data Security                            — 20% (13/65)
 *   - Cloud Platform and Infrastructure Security     — 17% (11/65)
 *   - Cloud Application Security                     — 17% (11/65)
 *   - Cloud Security Operations                      — 16% (11/65)
 *   - Legal, Risk and Compliance                     — 13% ( 8/65)
 *
 * These are independent study questions and are NOT real or official
 * exam items.
