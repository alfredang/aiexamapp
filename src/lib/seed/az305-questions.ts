/**
 * AZ-305 bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:az305-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedAz305(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/az305.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-az305`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Microsoft Learn docs
 * and the AZ-305 (Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions)
 * domain blueprint:
 *   - Design identity, governance, and monitoring solutions — 28% (18)
 *   - Design data storage solutions                          — 24% (16)
 *   - Design business continuity solutions                   — 18% (12)
