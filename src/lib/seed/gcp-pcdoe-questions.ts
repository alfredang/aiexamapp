/**
 * Google Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer (GCP-PCDOE) bundle seed —
 * vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned
 * questions. Idempotent: replaces rows tagged
 * `generatedBy: 'manual:gcp-pcdoe-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedGcpPcdoe(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/gcp-pcdoe.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-gcp-pcdoe`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Google Cloud
 * Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer exam guide and the Google Cloud
 * SRE / Cloud Build / Cloud Deploy / Cloud Monitoring documentation.
 * Questions are original scenario-based items — they are NOT copied from
 * any real exam and never claim to be the real exam. Blueprint:
 *   - Bootstrapping and Managing a Google Cloud Organization — 18% (12)
 *   - Building and Implementing CI/CD Pipelines             — 22% (14)
 *   - Applying Site Reliability Engineering Practices        — 22% (14)
 *   - Implementing Observability                            — 20% (13)
 *   - Optimizing Service Performance                         — 18% (12)
