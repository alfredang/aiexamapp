 * Idempotent: replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:iassc-gb-seed'`
 * and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedIasscGb(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/iassc-gb.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-iassc-gb`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public IASSC Lean Six Sigma
 * Green Belt Body of Knowledge and standard DMAIC statistical practice:
