/**
 * Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE) — grounded top-up.
 *
 * The existing PMLE practice variants P1–P3 were thin (37/37/38 published
 * questions) AND were originally generated from third-party practice-exam
 * PDFs. This module ADDS net-new questions authored against the official
 * Google Cloud / Vertex AI documentation to bring P1–P3 up to 60 published
 * questions each, distributed to the published PMLE blueprint. It does NOT
 * touch the pre-existing questions, the exam metadata, or the bundle — it
 * only inserts its own tagged rows and then resyncs questionCount.
 *
 * Idempotent: deletes + recreates only rows tagged
 * `generatedBy: 'manual:gcp-pmle-topup'`, keyed by exam SLUG (prod exam
 * codes diverge from local — see the top-up-by-slug rule). Re-running is a
 * no-op beyond recreating the same tagged set.
 *
 * Blueprint (already grounded in scripts/_google-batch.ts and prisma/seed.ts):
 *   Architecting low-code AI solutions                               12%
 *   Collaborating within/across teams to manage data and models      16%
 *   Scaling prototypes into ML models                                18%
 *   Serving and scaling models                                       20%
 *   Automating and orchestrating ML pipelines                        22%
 *   Monitoring AI solutions                                          12%
 *
 * These are independent practice questions authored from public Google
 * Cloud docs — not real or official exam items, and no claim of exam
 * accuracy or reproduction is made.
