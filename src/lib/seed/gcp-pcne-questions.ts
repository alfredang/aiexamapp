/**
 * Google Professional Cloud Network Engineer (GCP-PCNE) bundle seed —
 * vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned
 * questions. Idempotent: replaces rows tagged
 * `generatedBy: 'manual:gcp-pcne-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedGcpPcne(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/gcp-pcne.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-gcp-pcne`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Google Cloud
 * Professional Cloud Network Engineer exam guide and the VPC, Cloud
 * Interconnect, Cloud Load Balancing, and Cloud DNS documentation. The
 * blueprint domains and their official weights:
 *   - Designing, Planning, and Prototyping a Google Cloud Network   — 26% (17/variant)
 *   - Implementing Virtual Private Cloud Instances                  — 21% (14/variant)
 *   - Configuring Network Services                                  — 23% (15/variant)
 *   - Implementing Hybrid Interconnectivity                         — 14% (9/variant)
 *   - Managing, Monitoring, and Optimizing Network Operations       — 16% (10/variant)
