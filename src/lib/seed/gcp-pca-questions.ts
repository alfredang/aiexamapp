/**
 * Google Professional Cloud Architect (PCA) bundle seed — vendor, three
 * practice-exam variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions.
 * Idempotent: replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:gcp-pca-seed'`
 * and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedGcpPca(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/gcp-pca.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-gcp-pca`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Google Cloud docs and
 * the Professional Cloud Architect domain blueprint:
 *   - Designing and planning a cloud solution architecture        — 24% (16)
 *   - Managing and provisioning a solution infrastructure          — 18% (12)
 *   - Designing for security and compliance                        — 18% (12)
 *   - Analyzing and optimizing technical and business processes    — 13% (8)
 *   - Managing implementation                                      — 12% (8)
 *   - Ensuring solution and operations reliability                 — 15% (9)
