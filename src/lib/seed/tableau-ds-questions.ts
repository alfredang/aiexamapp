/**
 * Tableau Desktop Specialist bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam
 * variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent:
 * replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:tableau-ds-seed'` and
 * upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedTableauDs(db)` so the same code path is reachable
 * from the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/tableau-ds.ts`) and the
 * protected admin API (`/api/admin/seed-tableau-ds`) — letting us
 * bootstrap the production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Tableau Help docs and
 * the Tableau Desktop Specialist domain blueprint:
 *   - Connecting to and Preparing Data    — 25% (16 / variant)
 *   - Exploring and Analyzing Data        — 35% (23 / variant)
 *   - Sharing Insights                    — 20% (13 / variant)
