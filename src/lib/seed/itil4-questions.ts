/**
 * ITIL 4 Foundation bundle seed — vendor (AXELOS), four practice-exam
 * variants, bundle, and 260 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent:
 * replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:itil4-seed'` and upserts
 * catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedItil4(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/itil4.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-itil4`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is original, scenario-based, and grounded in the
 * public ITIL 4 Foundation syllabus / ITIL 4 publications. It is NOT a
 * reproduction of any real or official exam, and these questions do not
 * claim to be the live AXELOS examination.
 *
 * ITIL 4 Foundation domain blueprint (weights sum to 100):
 *   - Key Concepts of Service Management             — 20% (13/variant)
 *   - The Four Dimensions and Guiding Principles      — 25% (16/variant)
 *   - Service Value System and Value Chain            — 20% (13/variant)
 *   - ITIL Practices                                  — 35% (23/variant)
