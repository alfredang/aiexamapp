/**
 * SC-900 bundle seed — vendor (Microsoft), three practice-exam variants,
 * bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:sc900-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedSc900(db)` so the same code path is reachable from the
 * standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/sc900.ts`) and the protected admin
 * API (`/api/admin/seed-sc900`) — letting us bootstrap the production
 * database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public Microsoft Learn docs
 * and the Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals
 * (SC-900) domain blueprint:
 *   - Describe the concepts of security, compliance, and identity   — 13% (8)
 *   - Describe the capabilities of Microsoft Entra                  — 27% (18)
 *   - Describe the capabilities of Microsoft security solutions     — 35% (23)
 *   - Describe the capabilities of Microsoft compliance solutions   — 25% (16)
