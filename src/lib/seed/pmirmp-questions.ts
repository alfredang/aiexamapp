/**
 * PMI-RMP bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam variants, bundle,
 * and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent: replaces rows
 * tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:pmirmp-seed'` and upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedPmiRmp(db)` so the same code path is reachable from
 * the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/pmirmp.ts`) and the protected
 * admin API (`/api/admin/seed-pmirmp`) — letting us bootstrap the
 * production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is original, scenario-based, and authored against the
 * public PMI-RMP exam content outline, The Standard for Risk Management
 * in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects, and PMBOK Guide risk practices
 * (qualitative & quantitative analysis, EMV, decision trees, Monte Carlo
 * simulation, risk responses, and management/contingency reserves).
 * These are practice items only — they are not copied from, and do not
 * reproduce, any real PMI exam.
 *
 * PMI-RMP domain blueprint (sum 100):
 *   - Risk Strategy and Planning   — 22 (14 per 65-q variant)
 *   - Risk Identification          — 23 (15)
 *   - Risk Analysis                — 23 (15)
 *   - Risk Response                — 13 (8)
 *   - Monitor and Close Risks      — 19 (13)
