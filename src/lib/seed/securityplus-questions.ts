/**
 * CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) bundle seed — vendor, three practice-exam
 * variants, bundle, and 195 blueprint-aligned questions. Idempotent:
 * replaces rows tagged `generatedBy: 'manual:securityplus-seed'` and
 * upserts catalog rows.
 *
 * Exported as `seedSecurityPlus(db)` so the same code path is reachable
 * from the standalone CLI shim (`prisma/seeds/securityplus.ts`) and the
 * protected admin API (`/api/admin/seed-securityplus`) — letting us
 * bootstrap the production database without redeploying.
 *
 * Question content is authored against the public CompTIA Security+
 * (SY0-701) exam objectives and NIST publications. Per-variant domain
 * blueprint (65 questions each):
 *   - General Security Concepts                          — 12% (8)
 *   - Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations          — 22% (14)
 *   - Security Architecture                              — 18% (12)
 *   - Security Operations                                — 28% (18)
 *   - Security Program Management and Oversight          — 20% (13)
