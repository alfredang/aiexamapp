/**
 * Deterministic Fisher-Yates shuffle, seeded from a string.
 *
 * Same seed → identical output. Different seed → different output. Used to
 * randomise answer-option position per (attemptId, questionId) so the correct
 * answer's slot varies across users and attempts, but stays stable within one
 * attempt (so paging back/forth — and the post-submit results review — show
 * the same order the taker saw).
 *
 * Seeded RNG: FNV-1a hash of the seed → xorshift32 PRNG. Cheap, no
 * dependencies, statistically-uniform-enough for shuffling 2–6 options.
 *
 * Pure (no React/DOM), so it is safe to import from both the client exam
 * runner and the server-rendered results page. Keep the seed format
 * (`${attemptId}:${questionId}`) identical in every caller or the orders
 * will diverge.
