## Overview

Tertiary Exams is built to provide an end-to-end e-commerce and exam-taking experience. It solves the problem of managing certification preparation platforms by bundling practice exams and optional real-exam vouchers into unified e-commerce products. The platform is designed for scalable content generation using Claude AI and Firecrawl, enabling administrators to quickly author and maintain a large library of high-quality, blueprint-aligned practice questions.

**Current Status:** The core application features, checkout flows, exam runners, and admin dashboards are implemented and functioning.

## Tech Stack

| Area | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Node.js, Next.js API Routes |
| Database | PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM |
| Authentication | Auth.js (NextAuth v5 beta), Argon2 |
| Payments | Stripe, PayPal, HitPay, PayNow |
| AI / Integrations | Claude Agent SDK, Firecrawl API, Nodemailer, PDF-lib |
| Deployment | Docker, Coolify-ready |

## Architecture

ExamNova uses a monolithic architecture built entirely on the Next.js App Router. It leverages Server Actions for form submissions and Next.js Route Handlers for webhooks, external integrations, and cron workers. Data is persisted in PostgreSQL using Prisma.

```

## Repository Structure

- `prisma/`: Database schema, migrations, and seed scripts.
- `src/app/`: Next.js App Router pages (public marketing, checkout, exam runner, user dashboard, admin dashboard, API routes).
- `src/components/`: Shared UI components for frontend and dense admin data tables.
- `src/lib/`: Core business logic (analytics, invoice generation, payments, AI integration, coupons, settings, etc.).
- `scripts/`: Bulk question seeding, content generation, and utility scripts.
- `.claude/`: Project-specific Claude AI agent and skill instructions.
- `public/`: Static assets and logos.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v22+
- **Docker**: For running a local PostgreSQL database and MailHog.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfredang/ai-exams.git
   cd ai-exams
   ```

2. Install dependencies (requires `--legacy-peer-deps` due to some React 19 incompatibilities):
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. Copy the environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Configuration

1. Start the local database and mail server using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgres mailhog
   ```
   *(Postgres is exposed on port 55432, MailHog on port 8025)*

2. Open the `.env` file and configure the `DATABASE_URL` to point to the local instance (e.g., `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:55432/postgres`).

3. Note that most application configuration (Stripe keys, PayPal keys, Auth providers, SEO, Company Info, Email credentials) is managed **at runtime via the Admin Dashboard Settings** rather than environment variables.

## Running Locally

1. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   # Or npm run db:migrate if managing dev migrations
   ```

2. Seed the database with the initial admin user and catalog exams:
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

3. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- -p 3040 -H 127.0.0.1
   ```

4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3040`.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Generates the Prisma client and builds the Next.js application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint.
- `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript compiler check without emitting files.
- `npm run db:migrate`: Creates and applies development database migrations.
- `npm run db:deploy`: Applies pending database migrations (for production).
- `npm run db:seed`: Seeds the database with default vendors, exams, bundles, and admin users.
- `npm run db:studio`: Opens Prisma Studio to visually inspect the database.

## Usage

### User Flow
1. Visit the homepage and browse the `/practice-exams` catalog.
2. Select a bundle and try a free teaser attempt.
3. Sign up, proceed to `/checkout/bundle/[bundleId]`, and complete the payment using Stripe, PayPal, or HitPay.
4. Navigate to `/user-dashboard` to view purchased exams, vouchers, and start practice attempts.

### Admin Flow
1. Sign in using the seeded admin credentials.
2. Navigate to `/admin-dashboard` to view KPIs and manage the catalog.
3. Go to `/admin-dashboard/settings` to configure Payment Providers, Email Transports, and Social Logins.
4. Go to `/admin-dashboard/exams/[id]/author` to generate new exam questions using the AI integration.

## Database

The project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.

- **Schema:** Defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Seeding:** The `prisma/seed.ts` file populates the database with initial vendor data, multi-variant exam bundles, and admin user credentials.
- **Migration:** Run `npm run db:migrate` or `npx prisma db push` to apply schema changes.

## Testing

There is no automated test runner configured in the repository (e.g., Jest/Cypress). 

### Manual Testing
- **Local Dev Server:** Verify functionality manually on the local dev server.
- **E2E Smoke:** Use Playwright MCP for end-to-end smoke testing (homepage, catalog, checkout, login).
- **Email:** Use MailHog at `http://127.0.0.1:8025` to intercept outbound emails.
- **Payments:** Use Stripe/PayPal sandbox credentials for testing checkout flows.

## Deployment

The application is built for deployment on platforms like Vercel or self-hosted Docker environments (Coolify-ready).

### Docker Deployment
The repository includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` tailored for Next.js standalone output.

1. Ensure environment variables (`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET`, etc.) are configured in the deployment platform.
2. Build and deploy the Docker image. The container will automatically run `prisma migrate deploy` before starting the server.

## Security

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure you update default admin passwords provided in the seed script (`password123`) before deploying to production.

- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET` are randomly generated and securely stored.
- Most sensitive keys (Stripe, HitPay, OAuth Client Secrets) are stored encrypted in the `Setting` database table and decrypted at runtime.
- Next.js Route handlers acting as webhooks verify request signatures (e.g., Stripe, HitPay) before processing logic.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Error:** Ensure Docker is running and the `DATABASE_URL` port matches the exposed port (`55432` by default).
- **Next.js Hydration Errors:** Occur occasionally during development; restart the dev server or verify HTML markup nesting.
- **AI Generation Failing:** Check the Admin Dashboard Settings to ensure a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` are provided.
- **NPM Install Errors:** Ensure you pass the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to `npm install` to avoid conflicts with React 19.

## Known Issues

- The runner UI currently only supports `SINGLE`, `MULTI`, and `TRUE_FALSE` questions, despite the database schema supporting `ORDERING` and `HOTSPOT`.
- Formal compliance certifications (e.g., GDPR reporting features) are limited to data export requests.
- Role-based Access Control (RBAC) granular roles (Finance, Support, Content) are defined but mostly require strict `ADMIN` enforcement at the API proxy layer.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Define security and privacy acceptance gates before production use.
- [ ] Add automated test coverage for auth, payments, attempts, and admin mutations.
- [ ] Implement front-end support for `ORDERING` and `HOTSPOT` question types.
- [ ] Refine proxy permissions to utilize non-admin granular RBAC roles (`FINANCE`, `SUPPORT`, `CONTENT`).
